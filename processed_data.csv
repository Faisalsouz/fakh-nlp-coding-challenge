High leadership and management abilities, and particularly team management skills and capacities to provide distance technical support. Significant knowledge and experience of grant writing and management for major institutional donors, including EU, BHA/USAID, ECHO, UN Agencies (UNHCR, UNICEF, etc.) and pooled funding mechanisms, such as CHF.

A salaried position: According to experience, starting from EUR 2860 gross per month (2600 base salary + 10% annual leave allowance paid monthly) and a monthly Per Diem of USD 600. Starting from August 1st, 2023 onwards, the basic gross salary will be increased to 2800€/month as part of a review of the salary grid. SI also covers accommodation costs and travel expenses between the expatriate's country of origin and the place of assignment. Breaks: During the assignment, a system of alternation between work and time off is implemented at the rate of 7 working days every two months (with a USD 850 break allowance, allocated by Sl). Insurance package: Expatriates benefit from an insurance package which refunds all healthcare expenses (including medical and surgical expenses, dental care and ophthalmological expenses, repatriation) and a welfare system including war risks. Essential vaccination and antimalarial treatment costs are refunded. LIVING CONDITIONS: The security environment in Afghanistan remains tense, dynamic and volatile. While the risks associated with the conflict between the government and the armed opposition have significantly decreased since 15th of August 2022, third party armed groups (notably ISKP) continue to operate in certain provinces including Kabul and the possibility of the emergence of new opposition groups cannot be ignored. On the other hand, the country has always witnessed a certain level of criminality. The Deputy Country Director is living in a shared guesthouse with the other international staffs. Living conditions are quite fair in Kabul, with possible access to all essential goods and services. The security situation can be tense, and travel is sometimes restricted, but it is possible to have a social life. Living conditions in the field are often harsher (limited access to electricity, harsher weather conditions, isolation, etc.) with paradoxically, depending on the area, less strict security conditions.

423373891,"Attachments The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) monitors trends in staple food prices in countries vulnerable to food insecurity. For each FEWS NET country and region, the Price Bulletin provides a set of charts showing monthly prices in the current marketing year in selected urban centers and allowing users to compare current trends with both five-year average prices, indicative of seasonal trends, and prices in the previous year. Locally-produced rice is the most important staple food for households in northern and central Madagascar. Imported rice is a less-preferred substitute, but often consumed by poor households because it is cheaper than locally-produced rice and expands more during the cooking. Dried cassava is the primary staple food in the south, although it is consumed in other parts of the country during the lean season when household food stocks are low. Maize is the third most important staple and the second most consumed cereal in Madagascar. Antananarivo, the capital city, is the largest urban market and is the major hub for the country’s staple food trade networks. Antananarivo is a net consumer of staple food and is supplied by imports arriving through the port of Toamasina and from key surplus producing areas throughout the country. Antsirabe, the second urban market, is located in the surplus rice-producing Vakinankaratra region and one of the markets that supply Antananarivo. Located on the eastern coast, Toamasina is the main port city of Madagascar where major quantity of imported commodities comes before traded throughout the country.

423385208,"Heavy El Nino rains have already devastated parts of Somalia, particularly Baidoa; 107,000 people in Baidoa were affected by recent flooding, 86,700 internally displaced makeshift houses were destroyed; More than 12,000 cases of cholera have already been detected in Kenya, with more anticipated if floods hit. Nairobi, Kenya, October 11, 2023 The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is sounding an alarm following heavy flooding in parts of Somalia, particularly Baidoa in the southwest, and a warning issued by the Kenyan Meteorological Department (KMD) predicting heavy rainfall across numerous regions of Kenya from October this year through January 2024. Swift and substantial funding is critical to avert childhood malnutrition, protect livelihoods, and strengthen resilience programming for refugees and host communities in Kenya and riverine populations across Somalia. In Somalia, the IRC is set to activate a Crisis Modifier under a Nexus Project funded by the German Federal Foreign Office. The Modifier aims to provide crucial support to communities in flood-prone areas along the Hiraan region, to implement interventions geared towards mitigating the impact of flooding and delivering crucial aid to communities affected by conflict. The lack of sufficient funding to address the impacts of El Niño and of preparatory action could exacerbate the strain already placed on the humanitarian system. The 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan for Somalia is currently only 37-percent funded. In Baidoa, the epicentre of a hunger crisis following the last few years of drought, heavy flooding has already caused significant disruption to the city and poses a risk to the safety and well-being of the residents, particularly people currently living in internally displaced (IDP) camps. 107,000 people in Baidoa have been impacted by the floods on October 4. Further flooding is expected across Somalia, which is estimated to impact 1.2 million people who reside in riverine areas. This adds to the on-going humanitarian crisis in Somalia where more than 3.7 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. This number is expected to increase to 4.3 million between October and December 2023, in part due to the impact of flooding caused by El Niño. In Kenya, it's predicted that the impact of floods could leave more than 2 million people in need of some form of direct assistance. Of this number, around 600,000 are anticipated to be refugees, exacerbating the existing humanitarian crisis in the country, where 4.5 million people are currently facing hunger. Kurt Tjossem, IRC Regional Vice President for East Africa, said- 'We are operating in refugee camps and camps for displaced people where vulnerable populations are already grappling with disease outbreaks, and the healthcare system is stretched to its limits. After three years of devastating drought, this rainfall may initially be seen as a blessing for farmers and pastoralists in both Somalia and Kenya, however, it has the potential to quickly turn into a disaster as we see in Baidoa, with widespread flooding anticipated in the areas where the IRC operates. Since October 2022, Kenya's arid northern region has been grappling with a cholera outbreak triggered by a prolonged and severe drought, resulting in over 12,000 cases and 202 deaths as of September 15th. Disrupting rainfall patterns will severely affect agriculture, rural livelihoods, and food security, placing farmers and pastoralists at the forefront of its impact. In addition to supporting communities through emergency response, these floods highlight the need for anticipatory action measures, which must focus on safeguarding food, crops, water, and infrastructure to protect the food supply and support communities to prepare and respond to the anticipated flooding. We all remember the last El Niño in 2015/16, which resulted in landslides, flash floods, and building collapses. If immediate measures are not taken, the consequences to lives and livelihoods could be dire.' The IRC calls for prepositioned, flexible, multi-year financing to strengthen the El Niño response. In Kenya and Somalia, the IRC is conducting awareness-raising campaigns to prevent disease outbreaks; delivering critical supplies including hygiene and cash; enhancing water and hygiene infrastructure in anticipation of the floods; and deploying mobile health units to provide essential health services. East Africa is home to some of the IRC’s longest-running programs globally, with operations in Somalia for over 40 years, Kenya for 30 years and Ethiopia for 20 years. Today, over 2,000 IRC staff in the region are scaling up our programs to address the current drought and rising food insecurity, including expanding to new areas to meet severe needs.

423372747,"Highlights Another 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck Herat Province, western Afghanistan on the morning of 11 October. One person was reportedly killed, and an estimated 140 people injured in the earthquake, which struck 28 kilometres northwest of Herat City. Those injured from Herat City and Injil district were referred to Herat Regional Hospital and private healthcare facilities. Several villages across Gulran, Injil and Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai districts are understood to have sustained significant damage in the earthquake; humanitarian partners are mobilizing to assess the impact. This latest major earthquake comes just four days after the first 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck roughly the same area of Herat Province. Assessments completed to date indicate that 11,066 people (1,835 families) have been affected across Zindajan (1,398 families), Gulran (295 families), Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai (123) and Kohsan (19 families) districts. Informal reports estimate a further 6,000 people (1,000 families) have been affected in Injil district the epicentre of this morning’s earthquake. Areas newly affected by today’s earthquake will also need to be assessed. The number of those directly and indirectly affected is expected to rise. Some 1,714 homes across Zindajan (1,373), Gulran (295) and Kushk/Rabat-e-Sangai (46) districts are reported to have been completely destroyed in Saturday’s earthquake. Homes have also been severely and moderately damaged across Kushk/Rabat-e-Sangai (77), Zindajan (23) and Kohsan (19) districts. More than 290 livestock were also lost. To date, assessments have identified 38 unaccompanied minors and 24 unaccompanied elderly persons across both Zindajan and Kushk districts. Some 138 female-headed households were also identified in Gulran, Kohsan, Kushk and Zindajan districts. Additionally, 650 people are reported to have had their Tazkeras (civil paperwork) destroyed, all in Zindajan district. On 10 October, the Humanitarian Coordinator (a.i.) for Afghanistan, Daniel Endres, visited Zindajan district along with the representatives of IOM, OCHA and WHO, to meet with affected communities and to better understand the extent of the damage caused by the 7 October earthquake. In line with the scaled-up response efforts, the international community has also stepped up its support for affected populations. On 10 October, ECHO announced a €3.5 million earthquake response package to Afghanistan, while several donors have also announced new contributions to the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund totalling around US $9 million (Germany, €5 million; Switzerland, €2.5 million; Australia, AUD $1 million; Ireland, €500,000; and Japan, US $100,000). Additional donor contributions are anticipated. Humanitarian Needs and Response. Humanitarian partners continue to coordinate with the de-facto authorities (DfA), including the Provincial Governor, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation, and the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), as well as their respective departments at the sub-national level. Damaged housing, plus the fear of returning home due to persistent aftershocks, have resulted in the sprouting of several informal sites across Herat City. IOM and the CCCM Working Ground are on the ground assessing the situation amid concerns about the lack of access to basic services. Today’s earthquake has also newly-affected 112 villages across Herat (58), Injil (39), Kushk (8), Karuch (6) and Zindajan (1) districts, bringing the total number of affected villages to 444 since Saturday. In addition to response details outlined in Flash Updates 1, 2 and 3, cluster partners have so far assisted earthquake-affected communities with the following. Emergency Shelter (ES) and Non-Food Items (NFI) : IOM, UNHCR, and UNICEF have delivered emergency relief assistance including emergency shelter kits, plastic tarpaulin, NFIs, and other supplementary assistance to nearly 1,000 families across eight villages of Zindajan district. This includes the distribution of 965 family tents, 999 standard NFI kits and 500 blankets as supplementary assistance. IOM distributed 715 family tents and standard NFI kits to 715 families across seven villages in Zindajan district including Bultan (100), Mahal Babaji (121), Mahal Wardakah / Kernil (80), Kachkal (25), Sanjab (155), Sar Baland (50), and Sia Ab (184).

UNICEF has also committed to provide 4,000 NFI kits, 1,500 plastic tarpaulins and 750 winter clothing kits in support of the response and in coordination with the Cluster. NRC has dispatched 1,500 blankets to Herat Province and is further expected to provide seasonal cash for heating and fuel to 1,500 families once assessments have been completed. The Cluster has 23 partners working in the province, all involved and supporting community-level assessments currently underway. Food Security & Agriculture : WFP reports over 81.210 metric tons of mixed food commodities were dispatched to various locations, including Nayeb Rafi and Sia Ab villages in Zindajan district, Gulran Botan village in Gulran district, Herat Regional Hospital, Gazergah Transit Centre (GTC) and several smaller hospitals. The food targeted about 1,290 households (9,000 beneficiaries). WFP also erected two mobile storage units as distribution hubs in Zindajan district and have deployed a team to provide telecommunication facilities as local networks were disrupted by the earthquake. IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation is providing 200 hot meals in Zindajan district. Organization of the Coordination of Humanitarian Relief (OCHR), a WFP partner, conducted a rapid needs assessment in Herat and Baghdis provinces and identified food as an urgent priority.

Health : By 10 October, the Health Cluster partners reached 5,625 earthquake-affected people in Zindajan (3,704), Injil (836) and Herat (1,085) districts. More than 4,110 people have received primary health care and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services; 1,013 people have received trauma care and rehabilitation services, and 496 people have received different kits (mama and baby kits, dignity kits, individual clean delivery kits) and tarpaulin sheets. On 11 October, 19 mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNTs) were deployed to 20 affected villages of Gulran Khosan, and Zindajan districts. In Zindajan district, 17 MHNTs were deployed to Asyabadk, Chahak Mirandaziha, Charcheshma, Cheshma Ghoori, Ghar Mooshak, Kachkal, Koshkak, Lakasang, Mahal Wardakah / Kernil, Nayeb Rafi, Qasr-e-Shirin, Sarboland, Sia Ab, Sanjab and Siha villages. In Khosan district, one MHNT was deployed to Ahmadabad village, and in Gulran district, one MHNT to Butan village. These MHNTs will provide primary health care and MHPSS services in the shelters as static sites. At the same time, 30 MHNTs from World Vision (6), CARE (2), IRC (6), IRW (6), IOM (2), AADA (3), and Jhpiego (5) are on standby to deploy as needed. In addition, provincial medical associations in Balkh and Nangarhar provinces have donated medicines and cash worth more than US $23,000 (AFN 1,750,000) towards the Herat earthquake response. To address the immediate maternal and reproductive health (MRH) needs of the affected population, UNFPA and its partners provided five mobile health teams (MHTs) to provide services in Koshkak, Mahal Wardakah / Kernil, Nayeb Rafi, Sar Beland and Sia Aab villages of Zindajan district. In addition, two MHTs through UNFPA implementing partner HealthNet TPO provided lifesaving MRH services to the villages of Nayeb Rafi and Sia Aab in Zindajan district reaching 1,744 people. Some 1,027 blankets were also distributed. WHO also dispatched an additional 25 metric tons of supplies to Herat Province including medicines for trauma care, pneumonia, and treatment of severe malnutrition; orthopaedics and surgery equipment; basic hygiene supplies and personal protective equipment for health workers. The package further included 11 inter-agency emergency health kits (IEHK) and 65 trauma and emergency surgery kits (TESK) sufficient to treat 650 injured patients. In addition, provincial medical associations in Balkh and Nangarhar provinces have donated medicines and cash worth more than US $23,000 (AFN 1,750,000) towards the Herat earthquake response. Protection : As of 10 October, UNFPA through its partners (CARE, HealthNet TPO, AADA and MOVE) distributed 884 dignity kits, 907 blankets and 792 tarpaulins, and provided psychosocial support to 584 affected women and girls in 14 locations in Zindajan district. Sensitization on menstrual hygiene was also provided to 690 people in Mahal Baba Haji School (now closed), Herat Regional Hospital and GTC in Herat City. On the same day, UNICEF and War Child-UK provided MHPSS support at the GTC which is hosting 1,043 people (693 women, 138 girls, and 212 boys). Some 125 (56 girls and 69 boys) also participated in activities in two child-friendly space that had been installed at the centre. More than 130 women received psychological first aid (PFA) and 200 children (98 girls and 102 boys) received refreshments. UNICEF and War Child-UK also conducted a session on child protection for 50 women at the GTC. The Afghanistan Women Skills Development Centre (AWSDC), a local partner in Zindajan district deployed ten (five female) social workers for case management, eight (seven female) psychosocial support counsellors, and five (two female) community workers to assess and raise awareness on child protection issues in two villages. The Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Technical Working Group (MHPSS TWG) is using the ACF toll-free helpline 753 which is operational for eight hours a day to provide PFA. Through community-based protection approaches, community outreach volunteers created awareness of services provided by UNHCR and complaints and feedback reporting lines to affected persons in Asiabadak (two villages), Kachkal and Sia Ab in Zindajan district. In addition, DRC assessed 109 individuals in Herat City, mostly women-headed households and children displaced from the locations affected by the earthquake. DRC provided multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) to 84 of these but 25 of them moved to another location. Among some of those assisted on 10 October, 54 also received PSS services from the DRC protection team. Family reunification and support with the identification of family members in the affected villages were also provided. Family reunification efforts continue to be critical as families do not have access to communication and do not know where the injured individuals were taken. WASH : IOM distributed 30,000 litres of water through trucking to Sia Ab, Mahal Wardakah / Kernil and Kachkal villages in Zindajan district; fifteen handwashing stations were also installed in Asiabadak (5), Kachkal (4), Koshkak (2 villages) and Mahal Wardakah / Kernil (4). Some 127 hygiene kits were distributed to 60 households in Asiabadak (53) in Kachkal (7), while at the GTC, temporary/communal shelters and 128 hygiene kits were distributed to 118 families from Nayeb Rafi and Koshkak villages. Two blocks of latrines were installed at the GTC reception centre. UNICEF also provided nearly 9,500 individuals with water through trucking in Aghzalak (700), Bultan (700), Chema Ghoor (250), Ghar Moshak (420), Kachkal (175), Koshkak (770), Mahal Wardakah / Kernil (560), Nawabad (70), Nayeb Rafi (1,960), Sanjgab (1,085), Sar Balan (350) and Sia Aab (2,450) villages.

Thanks to UNICEF funding in the Centre-Nord region, 60 health staff were trained on the management of severe wasted children with medical complications The country has recorded high cases of dengue fever, especially in the Hauts Bassins region around mid-August 2023. To respond to this, UNICEF has supported communication to the public on the prevention measures of dengue fever. For example, 907 health workers have been oriented on the revised dengue fever guidelines in the eight districts of Haut Bassins and the transportation of samples and medical regulations. SITUATION OVERVIEW AND HUMANITARIAN NEEDS. The security context remains highly volatile throughout the country with a notable escalation in the frequency and intensity of armed conflict activities between government forces (FDS/VDP) on one side and armed group factions on the other. The ongoing deterioration in the security situation is having a devastating impact on the local population, mainly in rural areas, resulting in heavy human casualties and waves of civilian displacements towards central localities. Since the last reporting period, the trend of armed attacks against FDS and civilians has increased not only in frequency but also in scale. The humanitarian situation is exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, negatively affecting children’s rights and welfare, thus increasing their vulnerability. As of 31 May, 2,062,534 internally displaced persons (IDPs) were registered, however an update of this data is currently being validated by the relevant authorities. UNICEF continues to deliver its programmes in various locations despite the volatile security context. Since the beginning of the year, the health situation in areas affected by the humanitarian crisis has deteriorated further, with an increase in the number of health facilities closed (375) resulting in 3,398,560 people without healthcare as of the end of July 2023. The reduction in healthcare services at all levels of the health pyramid remains a major concern, especially in landlocked areas where referrals and medical evacuations have become increasingly difficult due to insecurity. Persistent displacement of populations continues to cause family separation of several children. The number of hard-to-reach areas has more than doubled over the past year, which has significantly delayed the implementation of some WASH construction works for IDPs and host communities. The country's hydrological context also poses additional difficulties, with negative boreholes being recorded more frequently, making access to water more challenging.",9367,highlights people include child gain access safe drinking water construction rehabilitation water supply system centre nord sahel boucle du mouhoun est region child age month receive vitamin supplementation new severely waste child include treat community level simplify approach thank unicef funding centre nord region health staff train management severe waste child medical complication country record high case dengue fever especially hauts bassins region mid august respond unicef support communication public prevention measure dengue fever example health worker orient revise dengue fever guideline district haut bassins transportation sample medical regulation situation overview humanitarian needs security context remain highly volatile country notable escalation frequency intensity armed conflict activity government force fds vdp armed group faction ongoing deterioration security situation have devastating impact local population mainly rural area result heavy human casualty wave civilian displacement central locality reporting period trend armed attack fds civilian increase frequency scale humanitarian situation exacerbate ongoing conflict negatively affect child right welfare increase vulnerability internally displace person idp register update datum currently validate relevant authority unicef continue deliver programme location despite volatile security context beginning year health situation area affect humanitarian crisis deteriorate increase number health facility close result people healthcare end july reduction healthcare service level health pyramid remain major concern especially landlocked area referral medical evacuation increasingly difficult insecurity persistent displacement population continue cause family separation child number hard reach area double past year significantly delay implementation wash construction work idp host community country hydrological context pose additional difficulty negative borehole record frequently make access water challenging
423361185,"The results of a randomized trial indicate a universal decolonization strategy could cut infection-related hospitalization in nursing home residents. The , published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that nursing homes that used a bathing routine to decolonize the skin and nasal passages of nursing home residents saw a significant reduction in infection-related hospitalization and all-cause hospitalization compared with nursing homes that didn't implement the strategy. The decolonization strategy also reduced the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The study authors say the strategy, which has been adopted in many hospitals to reduce bacterial infections in intensive care unit (ICU) and other at-risk patients, could help protect a population that is highly vulnerable to infections because of age and illness. Roughly three million healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including urinary tract and bloodstream infections, occur in nursing homes every year, resulting in 150,000 hospital admissions and 350,000 deaths annually. MDRO prevalence in nursing homes is four times higher than in hospitals. Nimalie Stone, MD, MS, a senior advisor for long-term care with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion and a technical advisory panel member for the trial, says the strategy is important not just for preventing drug-resistant infections in nursing home residents, but could also help protect them from the physical and emotional toll that hospitalization can take. 'Nursing homes are a critical part of our healthcare system,' Stone told CIDRAP News. 'I think it's incredibly exciting to have an infection prevention intervention that is actually making residents safer.' Routine antiseptic bathing and nasal swabs. The strategy was tested in the cluster-randomized Protect Trial, conducted in 28 nursing homes in California by a team led by researchers from Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the University of California Irvine School of Medicine. The 14 homes that were randomized to the decolonization group adopted a bathing and showering routine with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) soap. They also swabbed residents' nasal passages with nasal iodophor antiseptic twice daily for 5 days a week, every other week. The 14 nursing homes in the control group followed their standard bathing routines. To evaluate the effectiveness of the decolonization strategy, trial investigators compared hospitalization due to infection during an 18-month baseline period (September 2015 to February 2017) and an 18-month intervention period (July 2017 to December 2018). The secondary outcome was all-cause transfer to hospital. They also looked at the prevalence of MDRO carriage among residents during the two periods. A total of 28,956 nursing home residents were involved in the study—15,004 during baseline and 13,952 during the intervention period. The characteristics of the residents in the control and decolonization nursing homes were similar. In the decolonization nursing homes, the mean compliance with the CHG bathing routine and nasal iodophor application was 87% and 67%, respectively, during the intervention period. During the baseline period, the proportion of hospital transfers due to infection was 62.2% in the control nursing homes and 62.9% in the decolonization nursing homes. During the intervention period, the percentage of hospital transfers due to infection fell to 52.2% in the decolonization nursing homes (risk ratio [RR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 0.88), while remaining roughly the same (62.6%) in the control nursing homes [RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.04] The relative risk reduction in the decolonization nursing homes versus controls was 16.6%. I think it's incredibly exciting to have an infection prevention intervention that is actually making residents safer. Results were similar with regards to all-cause hospitalization. In the decolonization group, the proportion of all-cause hospitalization fell from 35.5% in the baseline period to 32.4% during the intervention (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96). In the control group, all-cause hospitalization rose from 36.6% during baseline to 39.2% during the intervention (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.12). The relative risk reduction versus controls was 14.6%. A microbiologic analysis of swab samples collected from residents of 24 nursing homes in the trial found that MDRO colonization prevalence fell from 48.9% in the decolonization group to 32% by the end of the intervention, while MDRO prevalence in control nursing homes fell only slightly (48.3% to 47.2%). The prevalence of any MDRO significantly declined in decolonization versus control nursing homes (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.84), with reductions in MRSA (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (RR, 0.29; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.62), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing bacteria (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.75). Stone said the 30% reduction in MDRO colonization is significant because of the high prevalence of MDROs found in nursing homes in this study and others—as high as 55% to 60% in some studies. Previous research has shown that colonization with resistant organisms like MRSA can increase the risk of infection. 'That's a pretty big impact, given the level of exposure [to MDROs] in this population,' she said. The number needed to treat in order to prevent one infection-related hospitalization and one all-cause hospitalization was 10 and 12 residents, respectively. The researchers estimate that the decolonization strategy, if applied to all residents in a 100-bed nursing home, could prevent two infection-related hospitalizations per month. 'Compared with other healthcare strategies, this is a relatively simple win for nursing homes, and we hope nursing homes will want to adopt it,' senior investigator, Susan Huang, MD, MPH, of the University of California Irvine School of Medicine, said in a press release from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. Transmission networks. But the findings could have impacts beyond nursing homes as well, according to Stone. That's because nursing homes are now commonly serving as a 'bridge' for patients coming from hospitals and long-term acute care facilities (LTACs), where they've had to exposure to antibiotics, in-dwelling devices (such as catheters), and other risk factors for MDRO colonization and infection. The constant movement of patients between these facilities creates networks of transmission that can increase the risk of drug-resistant infections in all of them. 'People move in and out of these different healthcare settings constantly, and those pathogens go with them,' she said. The strategy of decolonizing patients with CHG and a nasal antiseptic has been shown in other trials to reduce MDRO colonization and infection in intensive care unit (ICU), non-ICU patients with devices, and MRSA carriers follow hospital discharge. Stone says that if regional networks of nursing homes, acute care hospitals, and LTACs all used the decolonization strategy, you could see benefits in each of those environments. 'Decolonizing individuals across healthcare can really benefit the entire community,' she said.",9367,result randomize trial indicate universal decolonization strategy cut infection relate hospitalization nursing home resident publish yesterday new england journal medicine find nursing home bathing routine decolonize skin nasal passage nursing home resident see significant reduction infection relate hospitalization cause hospitalization compare nursing home implement strategy decolonization strategy reduce prevalence multidrug resistant organism mdros methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa study author strategy adopt hospital reduce bacterial infection intensive care unit icu risk patient help protect population highly vulnerable infection age illness roughly million healthcare associate infection hais include urinary tract bloodstream infection occur nursing home year result hospital admission death annually mdro prevalence nursing home time high hospital nimalie stone md ms senior advisor long term care center disease control prevention division healthcare quality promotion technical advisory panel member trial say strategy important prevent drug resistant infection nursing home resident help protect physical emotional toll hospitalization nursing home critical healthcare system stone tell cidrap news think incredibly exciting infection prevention intervention actually make resident safe routine antiseptic bathing nasal swab strategy test cluster randomize protect trial conduct nursing home california team lead researcher harbor ucla medical center university california irvine school medicine home randomize decolonization group adopt bathing shower routine chlorhexidine gluconate chg soap swab resident nasal passage nasal iodophor antiseptic twice daily day week week nursing home control group follow standard bathing routine evaluate effectiveness decolonization strategy trial investigator compare hospitalization infection month baseline period september february month intervention period july december secondary outcome cause transfer hospital look prevalence mdro carriage resident period total nursing home resident involve baseline intervention period characteristic resident control decolonization nursing home similar decolonization nursing home mean compliance chg bathe routine nasal iodophor application respectively intervention period baseline period proportion hospital transfer infection control nursing home decolonization nursing home intervention period percentage hospital transfer infection fall decolonization nursing home risk ratio rr confidence interval ci remain roughly control nursing home rr ci relative risk reduction decolonization nursing home versus control think incredibly exciting infection prevention intervention actually make resident safe result similar regard cause hospitalization decolonization group proportion cause hospitalization fall baseline period intervention rr ci control group cause hospitalization rise baseline intervention rr ci relative risk reduction versus control microbiologic analysis swab sample collect resident nursing home trial find mdro colonization prevalence fall decolonization group end intervention mdro prevalence control nursing home fall slightly prevalence mdro significantly decline decolonization versus control nursing home rr ci reduction mrsa rr ci vancomycin resistant enterococci rr ci extend spectrum beta lactamase produce bacteria rr ci stone say reduction mdro colonization significant high prevalence mdro find nursing home study high study previous research show colonization resistant organism like mrsa increase risk infection pretty big impact give level exposure mdro population say number need treat order prevent infection relate hospitalization cause hospitalization resident respectively researcher estimate decolonization strategy apply resident bed nursing home prevent infection relate hospitalization month compare healthcare strategy relatively simple win nursing home hope nursing home want adopt senior investigator susan huang md mph university california irvine school medicine say press release agency healthcare research quality fund study transmission network finding impact nursing home accord stone nursing home commonly serve bridge patient come hospital long term acute care facility ltacs exposure antibiotic dwelling device catheter risk factor mdro colonization infection constant movement patient facility create network transmission increase risk drug resistant infection people different healthcare setting constantly pathogen say strategy decolonize patient chg nasal antiseptic show trial reduce mdro colonization infection intensive care unit icu non icu patient device mrsa carrier follow hospital discharge stone say regional network nursing home acute care hospital ltac decolonization strategy benefit environment decolonize individual healthcare benefit entire community say
423384710,"Pennsylvania-based Venatorx Pharmaceuticals announced yesterday that it has received a $167 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop a novel oral antibiotic for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). The BARDA award will support development of ceftibuten-ledaborbactam etzadroxil, which combines a cephalosporin antibiotic with a novel, broad-spectrum boronic acid beta-lactamase inhibitor. Venatorx says the combination may offer a new oral treatment option for outpatient therapy to treat cUTIs and other serious bacterial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales. An estimated 2.8 million cUTI cases are diagnosed annually in the United States, and cUTIs caused by drug-resistant bacteria are on the rise. 'Currently, there are no approved oral antibiotics that are effective in the treatment of drug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections to help address increasing drug-resistant bacterial infections globally,' Venatorx President and CEO Christopher Burns, PhD, said in a company press release . 'We believe that oral ceftibuten-ledaborbactam etzadroxil could play an important role in treating drug-resistant gram-negative infections, preventing unnecessary hospitalizations, and saving lives.' Ceftibuten-ledaborbactam etzadroxil has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has recently completed phase 1 clinical studies. The drug will advance directly to phase 3 trials under the BARDA contract. NDA approved for ceftobiprole. In other antibiotic-development news, Swiss biopharmaceutical company Basilea Pharmaceutica announced last week that the FDA has approved its New Drug Application (NDA) for ceftobiprole. The company is seeking approval for treating patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and community acquired bacterial pneumonia. 'We are pleased with the FDA's acceptance of our New Drug Application, which is another important step towards bringing ceftobiprole to patients with severe bacterial infections in the US, as there is a high medical need for new antibiotic treatment options, especially in complicated SAB,' Basilea Chief Medical Officer Marc Engelhardt, MD, said in a",9367,pennsylvania base venatorx pharmaceuticals announce yesterday receive million contract biomedical advanced research development authority barda develop novel oral antibiotic complicated urinary tract infection cutis barda award support development ceftibuten ledaborbactam etzadroxil combine cephalosporin antibiotic novel broad spectrum boronic acid beta lactamase inhibitor venatorx say combination offer new oral treatment option outpatient therapy treat cutis bacterial infection cause multidrug resistant enterobacterales estimated million cuti case diagnose annually united states cutis cause drug resistant bacteria rise currently approve oral antibiotic effective treatment drug resistant gram negative bacterial infection help address increase drug resistant bacterial infection globally venatorx president ceo christopher burns phd say company press release believe oral ceftibuten ledaborbactam etzadroxil play important role treat drug resistant gram negative infection prevent unnecessary hospitalization save life ceftibuten ledaborbactam etzadroxil grant qualified infectious disease product fast track designation food drug administration fda recently complete phase clinical study drug advance directly phase trial barda contract nda approve ceftobiprole antibiotic development news swiss biopharmaceutical company basilea pharmaceutica announce week fda approve new drug application nda ceftobiprole company seek approval treat patient staphylococcus aureus bacteremia sab acute bacterial skin skin structure infection community acquire bacterial pneumonia pleased fda acceptance new drug application important step bring ceftobiprole patient severe bacterial infection high medical need new antibiotic treatment option especially complicated sab basilea chief medical officer marc engelhardt md say

Numbers may change if or when further information is made available. Join our mailing for the latest information or visit our map. “In 2022, we documented the highest number of attacks on health care in a decade with more than 1,900 attacks reported. These have continued into 2023 with high numbers reported in and Ukraine . The assaults on health care in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories mark the latest episode in this wider pattern. Their horrific consequences for patients and health workers will not only be immediate but will reverberate into the long-term at a time when access to health care could not be more crucial,” commented Insecurity Insight Director, Christina Wille. In Israel where three incidents were reported, a hospital was hit with rocket fire, a paramedic was shot and killed and an Indian nurse severely injured during attacks carried out by Hamas militants. In the oPt where 43 incidents were recorded, at least 10 incidents reported hospitals, including a Ministry of Health Building, eye hospital, and children’s department being extensively damaged, 16 health workers killed and 20 injured by explosive weapons used by Israeli forces. Gaza’s 13 hospitals and other health facilities are only partially functioning due to shortages of medical supplies and fuel to operate backup electricity generators. The siege imposed by Israel on Gaza and cuts to electricity severely hamper the continuation of medical treatments. Israeli airstrikes on the Rafah border crossing, the only exit and entry point not controlled by Israel, further undermine the ability of medical supplies to be transported into Gaza. In the West Bank, health providers face challenges in reaching casualties and preventing their transfer to and from the city of Nablus following the Israeli forces closure of all entrances and exits to the city. Health care in the oPt had already suffered severe levels of violence prior to the latest hostilities. Insecurity Insight documented 171 reported attacks on health care in the oPt in 2022 for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition , mainly involving injuries to health staff while they were providing care during protests or as a result of violence from Israeli security forces and settlers. Ambulances were repeatedly blocked at checkpoints and hospital entrances were obstructed. The factsheet is available in and Some hospitals affected in the oPt had already suffered attacks in recent years. In one incident on 09 October, the children’s section of Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital in Gaza, was damaged by Israeli forces shelling, causing parts of the ceiling to collapse and fall. During the 11-day military operation in Gaza in May 2021, Israeli forces’ bombardment damaged roads leading to the hospital, hindering the ability of ambulances to access the area. Aerial bombing by Israeli forces during this period impacted hospitals, clinics, and health workers at least 53 times. Insecurity Insight calls upon all conflict parties to uphold international humanitarian law. Health workers and facilities are protected. Perpetrators must be held accountable. NOTES TO EDITORS.

423402810,"Pakistan’s government has declared that all unregistered Afghan refugees must leave the country by November 1 or face deportation, raising concerns for over 200 Afghan journalists in exile and amplifying the challenges they face in the wake of the Taliban's crackdown on press freedom. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and its affiliates, the Afghan Independent Journalists’ Union (AIJU), Afghanistan National Journalists’ Union (ANJU), and the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), strongly urge Pakistan’s government to reconsider the directive and call on media stakeholders, civil society organisations, and international governments to increase their support for Afghan journalists in exile. At a press conference on October 3, caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti ordered the exodus of all undocumented immigrants and refugees in Pakistan by November 1, threatening to use either provincial or federal law enforcement agencies to ensure the deportation of those failing to abide by the order. The announcement was met with appeals from the United Nations (UN) and the International Organisation for Migration, outlining the grave risks facing those compelled to return to Afghanistan amid the country’s ongoing ‘severe humanitarian crisis’. At least 200 Afghan journalists are currently refugees in Pakistan, forced to flee the Taliban’s crackdown on press freedom, including draconian restrictions on women journalists, shuttering of media houses, and rampant censorship. Many face barriers to visa renewal, employment, and basic food and shelter, relying on family, declining personal resources, or temporary support from non-government organisations while awaiting relocation to third countries. Since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, over 1,600,000 Afghans have sought refuge in the neighbouring nations of Pakistan, Iran, and Tajikistan, with over 70 per cent being women and children. The latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimate that over 3,700,000 Afghans currently reside in Pakistan, with only 1,330,000 registered as refugees. Pakistan is not a signatory to the UNRefugee Convention and lacks a national asylum system. The UN’s contractee for refugee registration, the Society for Human Rights and Prisoners' Aid (SHARP) has been criticised for its protracted administrative processes, leaving many in Pakistan without a way to attain protection or the required documentation. The visas of many refugees who initially held regular entry permits have now expired. In response to the new order, the Federation of Afghanistan Journalists in Exile (FAJE), a newly formed organisation advocating for journalists in Afghanistan and the diaspora, called on the United Nations, Pakistani authorities, and international organisations to increase support measures for Afghan journalists in exile, cease the arrests and abuse in custody by law enforcement, and raised concerns over the wellbeing of journalists and trade unionists deported to Afghanistan. Recent months have seen multiple arrest and deportation efforts targeting Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The most recent crackdown resulted in the arrest and detention of more than 250 undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants in Sindh Province, with Taliban officials claiming over 1,000 Afghans had been arrested over the past two weeks. Pakistan has claimed the deportations will address safety and security concerns, which they allege have been partially caused by Afghan refugees. In August, the IFJ and the PFUJ established two solidarity centres in Islamabad to aid Afghan journalists, supported by UNESCO. These centres provide emergency housing, legal and psychological support, and basic needs, with one centre exclusively for women journalists. The AIJU said: “With the change of the system and the existence of bad unemployment and great economic problems, including the closure of the media, a large number of our media employees left Afghanistan and became refugees in different countries; between 250 and 300 journalists have applied for asylum in different countries. Currently, they live in uncertainty with their families. Their relatives live in the cities of Pakistan. Our expectation from the authorities of our friendly and neighbouring country Pakistan is to create a safe environment for the temporary life of Afghan media workers to prevent them from being harassed or deported.” The ANJU said, “ANJU strongly condemns the forced eviction of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, particularly Afghan journalists and media workers who have already faced immense challenges in their pursuit of reporting the truth. We call upon the Pakistani government to reconsider this decision and continue to provide a safe haven for Afghan journalists and media professionals who have sought refuge within its borders. Furthermore, we urge the United Nations and international organisations to step in and support Afghan refugees, with a particular focus on safeguarding the rights and security of Afghan journalists and media workers during this critical time.' The PFUJ said: “PFUJ has urged the Government of Pakistan to revisit its decision about Afghan citizens. Peaceful and legally living Afghans should be allowed to continue their stay in Pakistan on humanitarian grounds.” The IFJ said: “While the IFJ acknowledges Pakistan's historic support for Afghan refugees, including many of the nation’s journalists and media workers who have fought to maintain a free and informed society, now is the time to extend and amplify these measures to ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of all Afghans in exile. Journalists who are forced to return to Afghanistan may face arrests, detentions, or worse upon their return, and the Pakistani government must immediately reconsider its imminent expulsion order that will have a dire impact on all in the growing Afghan diaspora. International governments and civil society organisations must also provide additional support, increase humanitarian intakes, and expedite immigration processes to allow for Afghan refugees in Pakistan to resettle swiftly and safely.” For further information contact IFJ Asia - Pacific on ifj@ifj-asia.org.

423398247,"In the LAC region, unfavorable climate conditions and limited financial access continue to drive acute food insecurity. Key Messages In Haiti, most of the country continues to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes due to agricultural yields below five-year-average, high inflation, insecurity, and limited labor opportunities. Cité Soleil in Port-au-Prince will remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) due to a deficit in food consumption and livelihood deterioration. The start of the spring agricultural season was disrupted by the extended dry period followed by near-average rainfall, contributing to a drop in yields. Harvests are ending, however, in Center, South Coast, North-West, and North-East, where the rains arrive later, corn, beans, and rice harvest have started. Since March, the HTG has appreciated 11 percent against the USD. Despite this appreciation and the price declines, prices of basic food products remain atypically higher than the previous year (more than 50 percent for most) and the five-year average (more than 100 percent). An increase in acts of violence and kidnappings has been observed since June in Port-au-Prince, North-West, and Artibonite. The situation remains vulnerable, especially in Croix-des-Bouquets, Bon Repos, Tabarre, and Carrefour Feuille, where armed individuals attack civilian populations. This unrest continues to impact the normal functioning of markets and lead to population displacements. In Central America, abnormally high prices and a delay in primera harvests will exacerbate the lean season. The poorest households located in the Dry Corridor of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, highlands, and Alta Verapaz in Guatemala, which have less capacity to respond to previous shocks, and face a lack of food stocks below average incomes, will face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity outcomes until September, while the rest of the poor households urban and rural populations in the region will face Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. Starting in October, domestic harvests will lead to a seasonal drop in the prices of basic grains and an increase in labor opportunities until January 2024. However, some poor households applying Crisis coping strategies will persist in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). The rest of poor households will continue to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity. Due to El Niño phenomenon, a decline in primera and postrera production for subsistence farmers is expected. The erratic and deficient rainfall, exacerbated by the atypical increase in temperatures, will continue to affect the crops of small farmers who have limited resources. These conditions will result in a decrease in their food stocks, forcing them to rely on the market earlier than usual, with food prices higher than the five-year average. Starting in October, high labor demand will improve the purchasing power of poor urban and rural households. Activities related to commerce and tourism are expected to be close to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since 2020. Irrigated agricultural activities will have average labor demand, except coffee, which will decline due to unfavorable weather conditions, resulting in a drop in income for daily laborers who depend on the volume harvested. In Venezuela, the informal dollarization of its economy continues to mitigate worse levels of acute food insecurity. However, high food prices and other basic needs continue to restrict adequate food consumption for poor households, who face Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. The poorest households whose only source of income is in already depreciated local currency (VED) will continue experiencing gaps in their food consumption or applying coping strategies to cover their food needs, especially in cases where access to Social Protection Program benefits and international remittances is infrequent. These populations, which are usually concentrated in peri-urban areas of Distrito Capital and the states bordering Colombia, are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Seasonal improvements due to double salaries (Oct-Jan) and the availability of food from local crops at the end of the year will benefit the population, decreasing the number of households in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). As in the rest of the region, below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures will negatively affect soil moisture for crop development. Although large and medium-sized producers are expected to be able to cope with their irrigation systems, it is likely that small farmers will see reduced crop yields. Rice crops will be more affected. However, since most of Venezuela's food supply is imported, the impacts on acute food insecurity will be focalized. In July, the monthly cost of the basic diet and the diversified diet, in VED and in USD, remained stable with respect to the previous five months. However, the cost of both diets is still about 400 percent higher in VED than it was in July 2022; meanwhile, the cost in USD remained stable. During the remainder of 2023, food prices in VED are projected to be above 2022 and the five-year average. Local currency depreciation, inflation, and exchange rate fluctuations could affect VED price movements.",9367,lac region unfavorable climate condition limited financial access continue drive acute food insecurity key messages haiti country continue face crisis ipc phase outcome agricultural yield year average high inflation insecurity limited labor opportunity cité soleil port au prince remain emergency ipc phase deficit food consumption livelihood deterioration start spring agricultural season disrupt extend dry period follow near average rainfall contribute drop yield harvest end center south coast north west north east rain arrive later corn bean rice harvest start march htg appreciate percent usd despite appreciation price decline price basic food product remain atypically high previous year percent year average percent increase act violence kidnapping observe june port au prince north west artibonite situation remain vulnerable especially croix des bouquets bon repos tabarre carrefour feuille armed individual attack civilian population unrest continue impact normal functioning market lead population displacement central america abnormally high price delay primera harvest exacerbate lean season poor household locate dry corridor guatemala el salvador honduras highland alta verapaz guatemala capacity respond previous shock face lack food stock average income face crisis ipc phase acute food insecurity outcome september rest poor household urban rural population region face stressed ipc phase outcome start october domestic harvest lead seasonal drop price basic grain increase labor opportunity january poor household apply crisis cope strategy persist crisis ipc phase rest poor household continue experience stressed ipc phase acute food insecurity el niño phenomenon decline primera postrera production subsistence farmer expect erratic deficient rainfall exacerbate atypical increase temperature continue affect crop small farmer limited resource condition result decrease food stock force rely market early usual food price high year average start october high labor demand improve purchase power poor urban rural household activity relate commerce tourism expect close pre pandemic level time irrigated agricultural activity average labor demand coffee decline unfavorable weather condition result drop income daily laborer depend volume harvest venezuela informal dollarization economy continue mitigate bad level acute food insecurity high food price basic need continue restrict adequate food consumption poor household face stressed ipc phase outcome poor household source income depreciate local currency ved continue experience gap food consumption apply cope strategy cover food need especially case access social protection program benefit international remittance infrequent population usually concentrate peri urban area distrito capital state border colombia crisis ipc phase seasonal improvement double salary oct jan availability food local crop end year benefit population decrease number household crisis ipc phase rest region average rainfall average temperature negatively affect soil moisture crop development large medium sized producer expect able cope irrigation system likely small farmer reduced crop yield rice crop affected venezuela food supply import impact acute food insecurity focalize july monthly cost basic diet diversified diet ved usd remain stable respect previous month cost diet percent high ved july cost usd remain stable remainder food price ved project year average local currency depreciation inflation exchange rate fluctuation affect ved price movement

423318572,"UNOPS and UN Women will launch a campaign to call for action to empower women in rural areas. To mark International Rural Women’s Day, UNOPS and UN Women will launch a campaign to call for action to empower women in rural areas so they are better equipped to contribute to food security and climate change adaptation in their communities. From 9 October to 15 October (International Rural Women’s Day), UNOPS and UN Women across Africa will be sharing messages on social media and hosting events in different African cities such as Harare (Zimbabwe), Freetown (Sierra Leone), Tigray (Ethiopia), Kinshasa (DRC) and Juba (South Sudan), among others. The joint campaign aims to promote the role rural women play in supporting their households in achieving food security, generating income, improving rural livelihoods, and building climate change resilience. In Tigray, Ethiopia, UNOPS will be hosting a community discussion in Tigray, where stakeholders ―including women from the rural area, a government representative from Woreda and journalists ― will highlight the importance of addressing persistent gender gaps in the response to climate change and food insecurity. In addition, the discussion will also target how the existing projects have ensured the objectives are addressed in the project outputs. Addis Ababa, 08 October 2023― In Ethiopia, UNOPS is marking International Rural Women’s Day by launching the campaign to underline the contribution of rural women to development in Africa and highlight the importance of investing in gender-sensitive infrastructure that will allow women to have equal access to infrastructure as well as benefit from public expenditure. Moreover, women to have an increased role in decision-making processes in local development prioritization for an effective and sustainable contribution to food security and climate adaptation. The objective of the campaign is to call on micro and macro-level policymakers and decision-makers, members of societies, and international partners to action to support gender-responsive infrastructure in Africa that can empower rural women to access productive resources and opportunities, accelerate their socio-economic participation, and boost gender contribution to climate adaptation and food security. The campaign will include joint activities in several African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, among others. These events will be supported by a social media campaign in UNOPS and UN Women regional and national channels in Africa. On 13 October, UN Women Africa and UNOPS Africa will be hosting a live conversation, where stakeholders ―including a woman from an African rural area and a specialized journalist― will highlight the importance of addressing persistent gender gaps in the response to climate change and food insecurity. UNOPS Director a.i. for Africa Region, Dalila Gonçalves, said: “ Gender-blind infrastructure limits women’s access to financial resources, land, education, health, and other rights and opportunities. Also, it limits their capacity for coping with and adapting to climate change impacts. Women can play an active role as change-makers and educators in embedding sustainability within different infrastructure sectors. Supporting the empowerment of rural women through gender-responsive infrastructure, UNOPS helps low and middle-income countries across Africa in their journey toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. N Women Regional Director for East and Southern Africa and Regional Director a.i for West and Central Africa, Maxime Houinato, said: “Rural African women's pivotal role in bolstering regional economies and combating poverty is irrefutable. Yet, they grapple with pronounced challenges in securing vital agricultural resources, restricting their agricultural productivity and impacting their adaptability to climate change. UN Women studies reveal that gender disparities in agriculture have a direct impact on the economic growth of countries ranging from 13 to 28 per cent of GDP, equivalent to annually elevating 80,000 to 238,000 individuals above the poverty line per country. It's imperative that we advance programmes and policies that increase financing for rural women’s access to labour and time-saving equipment and services, fostering gender equality and improving rural women’s economic security.' According to UN Women , women make up more than 50 percent of Africa’s population and 80 percent of them reside in rural areas. The International Labour Organization states that giving women the same opportunities as men could raise agricultural production by 2.5 to 4 percent in the poorest regions and reduce the number of malnourished people by 12 to 17 percent. The UNOPS Report, ‘ Infrastructure for gender equality and the empowerment of women ’, stated that in rural areas inadequate infrastructure services disproportionately affect women’s time use because they bear the burden of household tasks, like collecting water and firewood, cooking, cleaning, and providing childcare. This limits the time available for pursuing educational, economic, or social activities. Women also face disadvantages when it comes to land and livestock ownership or equal pay which hamper their productivity and growth, resulting in weak rural economies, and impacting the local and global food systems and climate adaptation capacity.

423370901,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. The study brought together technical experts in gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment and a monitoring and evaluation team to collect and explore a range of data gathered from populations affected by humanitarian crises and response actors in the DRC. In total 322 women and 270 men (85 women and 44 men aged between 18 and 24, and 237 women and 226 men aged 25 and over) responded to a humanitarian assistance appreciation survey, 80 men and 122 women took part in focus groups, 15 women and 16 men told their individual stories, 16 women and 34 men were interviewed as key informants, and 61 women's organizations took part in consultative workshops. Secondary and primary data indicate an improvement in the integration of gender needs analysis, vulnerability factors and sex and age disaggregated data into humanitarian needs analysis. Several commitments to the implementation of inclusive assistance, cross-cutting protection and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse have been achieved thanks to a better understanding of gender issues and the participation of women at community level in the humanitarian response. Despite this progress, the integration of gender equality and women's empowerment programming into coordination mechanisms remains deficient, notably due to the absence of requirements and responsibilities for actors in the terms of reference defining the functions of these mechanisms, and the persistence of barriers to the participation of women's organizations in coordination structures. The survey of affected communities shows that humanitarian organizations are doing a better job of responding to gender-specific needs, and establishing a process of dialogue with communities before delivering goods and services that respect the principles of dignity and respect. However, shortcomings persist in terms of monitoring the quality and targeting of assistance, particularly in the management of feedback and complaints submitted through feedback mechanisms. As part of a continuum, the current crisis continues to have an impact on gender dynamics, without calling current norms into question. While some sometimes subtle changes have been noted, there is little evidence of significant, lasting change. On the one hand, women's workloads are amplified by the need to earn income while performing most unpaid work for the well-being of the household. However, as women's contribution to household income increases, so does joint decision-making within the household. The participation of women's organizations in humanitarian response coordination mechanisms is widespread but remains more passive than active. Participating organizations appreciate the sharing of information, the opportunity to create synergies with other organizations and to enrich advocacy for the rights of women and girls. Notwithstanding the above, several barriers persist, notably of a practical nature such as the use of new communication technologies, and due to a culture, that privileges the role and contributions of large international organizations to the detriment of local organizations. The recommendations made in this document are the result of an analysis of three interrelated and interdependent issues. The first is to explore the integration of gender equality into understandings of needs and programming in line with the normative framework, using secondary data, interviews with key informants from UN agencies and the assessment of assistance by populations receiving goods and services. Secondly, the aim is to provide information on the various implications of the humanitarian crisis for women and men, and on gender dynamics. It is about discovering the different needs, priorities, capacities, contributions and coping strategies of women, men, boys and girls during a humanitarian crisis. Finally, women's and/or women-led organizations were consulted to examine their level of participation, as well as the barriers to their involvement in coordination mechanisms and, more generally, in the humanitarian response.

423334561,"KEY MESSAGES. ● El Niño conditions are currently present and are forecast to continue through at least early next year. In East Africa, El Niño impacts vary geographically. Across western parts, El Niños are associated with below-normal rains from June to September. Meanwhile, across the Horn of Africa, El Niños are associated with above-normal rains and flooding between October and December. A positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is also underway and will likely enhance above-average rains in the Horn of Africa. ● In areas recently affected by drought, increased rainfall will likely help to support drought recovery, increasing agricultural production and driving an overall decline in food insecurity. However, in floodprone and riverine areas, there is a substantial risk of flooding, which could destroy critical infrastructure and assets, cause crop damage and livestock deaths, displace populations, limit humanitarian access, and lead to localized increases in food insecurity. ● Across certain western parts of the region, dry spells observed between June and September, along with conflicts and socioeconomic challenges limiting access to inputs, could reduce agricultural production and exacerbate already very high levels of food and nutrition insecurity. ● Forecast flooding will likely drive additional population displacements in a region with already about 18 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, water-borne diseases, protection and gender-based violence (GBV) risks, and other humanitarian challenges. Persons with disabilities are disproportionately at risk of losing access to life-saving services. ● Floods are likely to reduce access and cause damage to existing water sources and sanitation infrastructures. The combination of damaged infrastructures, contaminated water sources, and population displacements may cause surges in malnutrition. ● Flooding and intense rainfall may cause water- and vector-borne disease outbreaks, as well as damage to or closures of health facilities. This in turn may reduce regular health service delivery and restrict access to healthcare. Likely population displacements and related overcrowding in locations hosting IDPs may further increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. ● Most countries already have in place policies, institutions, contingency plans and other initiatives for risk mitigation, preparedness, and emergency response for climate hazards. However, it is critical to urgently revise and/or implement existing tools while ensuring that preparedness, anticipation, and response efforts are informed by climate forecast updates and take into account the increased risks faced by certain vulnerable populations, such as women, girls, and persons with disabilities.",9367,key messages el niño condition currently present forecast continue early year east africa el niño impact vary geographically western part el niños associate normal rain june september horn africa el niños associate normal rain flooding october december positive indian ocean dipole iod underway likely enhance average rain horn africa area recently affect drought increase rainfall likely help support drought recovery increase agricultural production drive overall decline food insecurity floodprone riverine area substantial risk flooding destroy critical infrastructure asset cause crop damage livestock death displace population limit humanitarian access lead localize increase food insecurity certain western part region dry spell observe june september conflict socioeconomic challenge limit access input reduce agricultural production exacerbate high level food nutrition insecurity forecast flooding likely drive additional population displacement region million internally displace person idp displace population particularly vulnerable food nutrition insecurity water bear disease protection gender base violence gbv risk humanitarian challenge person disability disproportionately risk lose access life save service flood likely reduce access cause damage exist water source sanitation infrastructure combination damage infrastructure contaminate water source population displacement cause surge malnutrition flooding intense rainfall cause vector bear disease outbreak damage closure health facility turn reduce regular health service delivery restrict access healthcare likely population displacement relate overcrowding location host idp increase risk infectious disease outbreak country place policy institution contingency plan initiative risk mitigation preparedness emergency response climate hazard critical urgently revise implement exist tool ensure preparedness anticipation response effort inform climate forecast update account increase risk face certain vulnerable population woman girl person disability

423377738,"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts were today granted access to the rooftop of reactor unit 2 of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and did not observe any mines or explosives there, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said. From the top of the building, the IAEA team could also observe the entire rooftop of its turbine hall as well as parts of the rooftops of the reactor buildings and turbine halls of units 1 and 3, also without seeing any mines or explosives, Director General Grossi said. The team will continue making its long-standing request to also visit the rooftops of reactor units 1, 5 and 6 to monitor compliance with the five concrete principles for protecting Europe’s largest nuclear power plant (NPP) during the military conflict in Ukraine, which state that it should neither be attacked nor be used as a base for heavy weapons. Today’s development comes after IAEA experts on 3 August were allowed access to the rooftops of units 3 and 4, following reports that explosives may have been placed there. Also at that time, they did not observe any mines or explosives. “After repeated requests in recent months, we were at last able to go to one more reactor rooftop. While this is a step in the right direction, we still need more access to assess adherence to the five principles, which were presented and gained support at the United Nations Security Council. We will continue to insist until this is granted,” Director General Grossi said. The IAEA experts also require access to all six turbine halls to be able to confirm the absence of any materials and equipment that may contravene the five principles. This request has not yet been approved and the IAEA team can only confirm the status of one turbine hall at a time. Highlighting the risks facing the plant during the military conflict, the IAEA team at the site has continued to hear explosions almost every day. Usually, they appear to occur some distance away from the plant, but yesterday four blasts took place closer to the site. “Without any doubt, the nuclear safety and security situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant remains highly precarious. We will continue to do everything we can do help prevent a nuclear accident during the war in Ukraine,” Director General Grossi said. Of the ZNPP’s six reactors, five remain in cold shutdown, while unit 4 continues to be in a state of hot shutdown to generate steam to heat water for the nearby town of Enerhodar where most plant staff live and to process liquid radioactive waste. As previously reported, Ukraine’s national regulator, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), has issued regulatory orders to limit the operation of all six units of the ZNPP to a cold shutdown state. In addition, the IAEA has been strongly encouraging the ZNPP to find an alternative source of steam generation to cover the plant’s needs and allow for all the reactors to be maintained in a cold shutdown state. The ZNPP is continuing to conduct maintenance activities on unit 6 following its transition to cold shutdown earlier this month. The IAEA experts were informed that the site performed testing on two of the unit’s steam generators due to the presence of boron in the secondary circuit, which is an indicator of a leak, albeit much smaller than that found in one of the steam generators of Unit 4, which was subsequently repaired. In unit 6, the tests performed by the ZNPP identified small water leaks in one tube of each steam generator, which have now been repaired and testing is being performed to confirm the successful repair. The IAEA experts are also continuing to monitor the water situation at the plant following the destruction of the downstream Kakhovka dam in early June. To find alternative sources of cooling water for the reactors and spent fuel, the plant has recently completed the construction of 11 underground wells which are together supplying around 250 cubic metres per hour, which the site had estimated would be sufficient to maintain the level of all 12 sprinkler cooling ponds, which have remained steady following some issues with their levels in late September. Over the past week, the IAEA team has conducted walkdowns across the site, including within the site perimeter, in the main control room and reactor building of unit 5 and in the reactor building of unit 6. The experts have also observed testing of the safety system of unit 2 and maintenance activities on the transformer of unit 6. During these walkdowns, the team did not observe any new mines or explosives. As part of these activities, the IAEA experts also closely observe the performance of the operating staff as the team collects more information about the status of staffing and the training and licensing of staff at the plant. IAEA teams at Ukraine’s three other NPPs and the Chornobyl site report safe and secure operations of these nuclear facilities despite the continuation of the armed conflict. The IAEA team based at the Rivne NPP said it had completed scheduled maintenance of unit 2, including the successful loading of a new type of fuel into this reactor. After it was re-started, the reactor was today reconnected to the grid. Over the past week, the IAEA completed its 27th and 28th deliveries of equipment and other items designed to enhance nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, providing two Starlink terminals with associated equipment to the Khmelnytskyy NPP to support reliable communications to and from the site as well as a mobile helium leak detector with accessories for tightness control to the South Ukraine NPP.

423379948,"FAO Director-General addresses first Vatican Roundtable of African Farmers. Rome - The Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), QU Dongyu, today called for immediate action to help Africa get back on track to meet global goals on food security and nutrition, pointing to science, technology and innovation, investments, and the continent's reservoir of resourceful youth, as potential solutions. Qu was invited to address the first Vatican Roundtable of African Farmers, an event designed to provided farmers from Sub-Saharan Africa with the opportunity “to bring their unique perspectives and concrete experiences to the forefront of global discussions on agricultural development in their region,” organizers said. African policy makers, UN leaders, development organizations, international financial institutions, private sector, academia, and civil society were also invited. Farmers from Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe presented concrete cases of agricultural innovation and technologies and advanced key policy recommendations. The meeting took place just days before the opening of the World Food Forum . FAO's flagship annual event is designed to foster dialogue and debate among relevant stakeholders, ranging from the young and the youthful, farmers, small-scale producers, Indigenous Peoples, policymakers, agri-investors and scientists, all with one goal: moving the needle for food security to achieve better production, better nutrition, better environment and better life, leaving no-one behind. Africa has been a strong focus of FAO's efforts since its foundation, nearly 60 years. Unfortunately, the number of undernourished people there has risen to over 281 million since the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic, while conflicts and the climate crisis continue to plague the continent. Just this year, Cyclone Freddy struck Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and there are ongoing droughts in Uganda and Somalia. And while Sudan, Mali, Niger and others continue to be gripped by conflict, new data released only two weeks ago confirmed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be one of the world’s largest food crises, with one-quarter of the population more than 25 million people - facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity. This all means that Africa is not on track to meet the global goals on food security and nutrition set out in the    , nor the goals of the Malabo Declaration agreed to by Members of the African Union. 'In Africa, we critically and urgently need more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable agrifood systems to increase agricultural productivity to be 2 times higher than what it is now,' Qu said. Potential solutions. In his address to the gathering, the FAO Director-General focused on possible solutions, and 'how we can move quickly to implement them.' Science, innovation and technology, for instance, offer significant opportunities for economic growth and the creation of new jobs in agrifood systems by contributing to producing more with less; by reducing food loss and waste, by helping food production adapt and mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis, and by improving access to finance and market information. But only if their advances are accessible to everyone. Secondly, creating real change and at the scale requires investments, not just for agricultural businesses, but also for agricultural research, training for farmers, mechanization, as well as the introduction of new technologies and new crop varieties, and sustainable production systems. In this context, FAO engages with the private sector through flagship initiatives such as the Hand-in-Hand Initiative , which is designed to accelerate agricultural transformation and sustainable rural development and currently includes 36 African countries. Finally, with the highest percentage of youth in the world, more should be done to empower the continent's youth, whose agility, creativity and ability to innovate can be a game-changer in the efforts to overcome poverty and hunger in the region,' Qu said. This is the reason why youth engagement is one of the three pillars of the World Food Forum, which the Director-General created in 2021. Today’s roundtable was held at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, in Vatican City, and was sponsored by Bayer AG, with the patronage of the Pontifical Academy for Life.

423382266,"By Lilianne Nyatcha et Carine Tope. Ces dernières semaines, la Force de la MONUSCO en collaboration avec les Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo a lancé et intensifié les offensives contre les groupes armés réfractaires au processus de paix en Ituri. Pendant deux semaines, la MONUSCO et son partenaire FARDC ont lancé l’opération Spider web en territoire de Djugu afin de protéger les civils contre d’éventuelles attaques armées. Ces opérations ont produit des résultats , a affirmé vendredi 6 octobre à Goma le porte-parole militaire de la Force, le lieutenant-colonel Kevin Byabato du contingent tanzanien, lors d’une interview accordée à Radio Okapi, la radio onusienne. Cette offensive a permis de neutraliser huit combattants CODECO et de prendre d’assaut leur camp. Le lieutenant-colonel Kevin Byabato a rappelé que les combattants CODECO utilisaient la chaîne de montagne de Mbau comme forteresse, et qu’à partir de cet emplacement, ils lançaient des attaques contre les positions et les points de contrôle des FARDC : Ils utilisent des femmes et des enfants comme bouclier humain, ce qui est considéré comme un crime de guerre par la convention de Genève , a-t-il fustigé devant les journalistes. Ces opérations auront été salvatrices pour la population. Depuis le 5 octobre 2023, des mouvements de retour des populations déplacées par les combats ont été signalés. Rappelons que l’opération Spider web avait pour but de contrecarrer toutes les actions de l’ennemi et permettre aux populations civiles de reprendre une vie normale. Sa planification ainsi que son exécution ont été couronnées de succès et ont démontré l’importance de la coopération entre la MONUSCO et les FARDC dans le but de protéger les civils et de créer un environnement protecteur en territoire de Djugu , a indiqué, pour sa part, le major Hassan Kheira du bureau du porte-parole militaire de la Force. Ces offensives minutieusement planifiées ont été conduites dans les zones de Djugu centre, Pimbo et Masikini dans le secteur de Djatsi. Après la phase préparatoire avec le déploiement de la logistique et des troupes, les actions décisives ont débuté le 29 septembre et se sont concentrées sur la localité de Masikini. C’est à partir de cette position que les miliciens ont régulièrement mené des attaques le long de la route nationale 27. En septembre dernier, les FARDC y avaient neutralisé quatre miliciens CODECO. Des miliciens déroutés. Les soldats de la paix et les FARDC ont détruit le camp de la CODECO de Masikini, contraignant ainsi les miliciens à se replier dans la brousse, en direction du village Likopi dans le groupement Budhu, dans le secteur de Walendu Djatsi. Comme du côté de la MONUSCO, le lieutenant Jules Ngongo, porte-parole des FARDC en Ituri, se réjouit lui aussi de ces offensives conjointes entre les deux forces partenaires : Elles entrent dans le cadre de la mutualisation des forces sur le plan tactique et opérationnel, afin de protéger les populations congolaises contre toutes velléités des groupes armés qui sont encore hostiles au processus de paix. L’officier militaire congolais rappelle qu’il est indispensable de mettre hors d’état de nuire les milices qui ne veulent pas adhérer au processus de paix initié par les autorités et pour lequel certains traînent les pieds. Il regrette cependant que les miliciens semblent avoir pris le goût de s’attaquer aux paisibles populations, aux sites de déplacés, de tendre des embuscades et de mener des opérations de survie sur le dos de la population. Le chef des opérations du secteur Nord de la sécurité de la MONUSCO, le lieutenant-colonel Saifur Rahma, souligne que ces offensives impliquent trois contingents de la MONUSCO et permettent de faire passer un message aux groupes armés : Ils ne peuvent plus opérer comme s’ils étaient en terrain conquis, et sans risque pour leur vie. Implication de la population. Si l’opération Spider web a produit des résultats, c’est aussi grâce à l’implication, au soutien et à la collaboration des communautés locales. Le lieutenant-colonel Saifur Rahma salue cet élan patriotique. Le chef du secteur Walendu Djatsi, Justin Gudza, a personnellement participé à la sensibilisation sur le terrain pour encourager le retour des familles dans leur milieu d’origine. En outre, l’autorité locale a lancé un SOS pour une assistance humanitaire en faveur de certaines personnes déplacées qui n’ont plus de moyens de survie.

While the sub-region continues to face many complex challenges in an equally complex and difficult global economic and geopolitical context, strong and determined voices, full of energy and hope, are being heard despite the deafening din of “bad news” reported almost daily by the media. These are the voices of young West African women and men who are committing themselves with enthusiasm and responsibility to help build a better future for their countries and the entire sub-region. Aware of the nature of the challenges and the usefulness of their involvement, young women and men are now key players in economic and political development. They already play a leading role, and want to continue to do so in resolving all the major issues facing the societies and governments of the countries in the sub-region. This is indeed the meaning of our commitment to young women and men, through the implementation, in partnership with ECOWAS, of Resolutions 2250 (2015), 2419 (2018) and 2535 (2020) on youth, peace and security. The 3rd Annual West Africa and Sahel Youth Forum, organized last July in Mindelo, São Vicente Island, in partnership with ECOWAS and the government of the Republic of Cabo Verde on the theme: “Empowering young women and men through quality education, decent work and innovative solutions to make conflict prevention more effective in maintaining peace and security in the region,” and the Mindelo Call to Action that crowned the Forum’s three days of work, testify to the growing role of young people and the need to include their vision in the treatment of subjects linked in particular to Peace and Security. The holding in Accra last August of the annual meeting of the Women, Youth, Peace and Securitý Working Group in West Africa and the Sahel, a coordination mechanism for the implementation of Resolutions 1325 (2000) and 2250 (2015), organized in collaboration with our partners, UN Women and ECOWAS, illustrates our ongoing commitment to supporting an inclusive, multi-actor platform where women and youth act for conflict prevention and peacebuilding in West Africa and the Sahel.

423389784,"Amman, Jordan, October 11, 2023 The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is horrified by the mounting civilian toll and the destruction of residences and public infrastructure as violence continues across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The IRC strongly supports the UN Secretary General’s call for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to be upheld; to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure at all costs; to allow full and unrestricted access to aid for civilians in Gaza; and to mobilize the international community to provide immediate humanitarian support for those that need it. Over 1,200 civilians in Israel have been killed by rocket attacks in residential areas and acts of violence in civilian communities. There are reports of at least one hundred hostages taken. At least 900 civilians have been killed in the oPt and thousands more injured as airstrikes destroy schools, health facilities, and residential areas in the highly populated Gaza strip. Over 260,000 people reportedly have been displaced within Gaza since the current escalation of violence began. Public infrastructure has also been destroyed, meaning thousands of people will soon be left without food, electricity, water and fuel.Even before this crisis, 80% of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid and 95% of the population did not have access to safe water. It is critical that all parties uphold IHL which demands protecting civilians and the infrastructure they depend on to survive. Hospitals, electricity and water plants must not be targeted. Authorities must ensure the basic needs of civilians - including access to water, food, medicine - are met. We call for adherence to IHL in order to avoid further civilian harm and mitigate the humanitarian fallout. The IRC is assessing needs on the ground and our capacity to ensure critical, life-saving humanitarian relief reaches affected civilian populations. The IRC works across the MENA region to support those in need across every aspect of their lives in order to restore safety, health, education, economic wellbeing, and meaningful measures of self-resilience.

423396199,"Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to brief the Security Council as it takes up the latest report of the Secretary-General on the Verification Mission in Colombia. As always, I am honored to be joined by Minister of Foreign Affairs Álvaro Leyva, and once again I thank him and the Government of Colombia for their continued trust in the work of the Mission in support of peace. I also welcome today the participation of Rodrigo Botero in this meeting. He is a leading Colombian environmentalist and participant in current peace efforts, his work thus illustrates the important connections between conflict, peacebuilding and the environment. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Council, We meet amid approaching milestones in the peace process, ahead of the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Final Peace Agreement and as the halfway point nears in the 15-year timetable for its implementation. Those who have deeply studied Colombia’s armed conflict point to skewed land distribution and the failure to enact needed rural reforms as one of its root causes. It is for this very reason that the parties to the Agreement placed comprehensive rural reform at its heart, making it the first chapter in the accord and the area requiring the most substantial long-term investments. It is not surprising, therefore, that lagging progress in this area in the initial years of implementation has limited the extent to which the Agreement has been able to bring the expected transformations to long marginalized rural and conflict-affected areas. Nevertheless, while a great distance still remains to attain the ambitious goals of the Agreement in this respect, I wanted to begin my briefing today with an acknowledgement of the increasing governmental efforts underway to bring about these reforms. I would say that a commitment to this particular section of the Agreement, in addition to the new peace dialogue initiatives, were the outstanding features of the recently concluded first year of the Petro administration as it sought to further consolidate peace in the country. Important policy actions in this regard are highlighted in the Secretary-General’s latest report, which recalls a year marked by substantial budget allocations for rural reform and its prioritization in the National Development Plan, increased dialogue with peasants and landholder organizations, and recent steps such as the establishment of the National Agrarian Reform system and the designation of four priority regions for comprehensive interventions in rural development. The commitment is brought to life in human terms in scenes such as that witnessed this past weekend in the town of San Juan de Arama, in the southern Department of Meta, where land purchased by the Government was delivered to some 500 beneficiaries, among them former FARC-EP combatants, peasants and indigenous members of the communities where they have resettled. Hopeful moments such as these are an increasingly common occurrence today, as Colombia’s Government takes up with greater dynamism this crucial, overdue aspect of the Peace Agreement. The most recent report of the Secretary-General also contains multiple examples that illustrate the interdependence between the implementation of the 2016 Final Peace Agreement and other efforts by the Government of President Petro to consolidate peace. A few weeks ago, I visited the former Territorial Area for Training and Reintegration of Carrizal, in Antioquia department, where more than 50 former FARC-EP members and their families live alongside members of the local community. There, as in similar locations around the countryside, one can see the admirable persistence of former combatants and communities joining efforts to improve their lives and realize the transformations foreseen in the Final Peace Agreement. In a project supported by the Mission, women former combatants who work in artisanal mines have augmented their incomes and that of the community by crafting and selling jewelry. Former combatants and community members have also joined forces in planting trees to counter deforestation. However, as I also heard in my conversations with ex-combatants and leaders of social organizations, these initiatives have been imperiled because of threats from illegal armed groups. In fact, this reintegration area is, like several others before it, likely to be relocated in the near future owing to insecurity. As the relocation is planned, I reiterate my call on authorities to ensure dignified living conditions in the new location and to continue to look after the safety and well-being of communities who remain behind. Allow me also to condemn, once more and in the strongest terms possible, the killings of former FARC-EP combatants, two since the report was issued. Nearly 400 former combatants have been killed since the signing of the Peace Agreement. This is simply unacceptable and calls for urgent and concrete measures from the authorities for their protection, as well as that of social leaders and human rights defenders. Mr. President, An important step in that direction is the recent adoption by the National Commission on Security Guarantees of the long overdue public policy to dismantle illegal armed groups and criminal organizations. This policy a product of consultations between the Government and civil society seeks to address the multiple causes favoring the creation and strengthening of criminal actors. Its implementation should help authorities to respond effectively to the ever-evolving threats in the territories. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Council, The multiple expressions of violence that persist in several regions of Colombia should not continue to hinder implementation. The dialogue initiatives with armed actors promoted by the Government are undoubtedly a necessary additional effort to deactivate these threats and reverse their impact on communities by allowing the pending commitments of the Peace Agreement to materialize. This is particularly true for Indigenous and Afro-Colombian territories, in regions such as the Pacific, where the actions of armed groups and the limited implementation of the ethnic chapter of the Agreement keep communities under intolerable levels of violence and lack of opportunities. Mr. President, I would like to once again welcome progress at the negotiation table between the Government of Colombia and the National Liberation Army (ELN). In particular, I would like to highlight the development of the bilateral ceasefire, which has resulted in a de-escalation of the conflict between the parties. I also underscore the importance of the Council’s support in allowing the Mission to contribute to this process through its participation in the Monitoring and Verification Mechanism. This mechanism is contributing to the prevention and resolution of incidents between the parties. I am also pleased to report, thanks to the contributing countries, about the recent arrival to the country of 31 of the 68 international observers authorized by this Council and deployed specifically for the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire. The work of the National Participation Committee installed in August to promote the participation of all sectors of the Colombian society in the peace process with the ELN is also moving forward. Yesterday, the negotiation table met, for the first time, in Bogota, proof of how the process is taking root in Colombia. Mr. President, We view positively the dialogues between the Government and the group that identifies itself as Estado Mayor Central FARC-EP. The parties announced last weekend a suspension of offensive actions against each other, and their intention to establish peace talks along with the entry into force of a bilateral ceasefire as of 16 October. I have been informed that the parties will soon request this Council that the Mission can be authorized to participate in the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire. I will make sure that this Council all the information necessary to consider this request. The expectations generated by progress towards the construction of a peace process must be matched with the fulfillment of reached commitments, with the de-escalation of confrontations and, especially, with the respect for the rights of communities, social leaders and signatories of the 2016 Agreement. The constant demonstration of the will of the parties requires, necessarily, avoiding the repetition of events such as the attacks in Cauca department last month, which resulted in the tragic death of civilians from communities that have been seeking peace for decades. President, Distinguished Members, As we meet in the month of October, which marks the anniversary of resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, I salute the Government of Colombia and civil society organizations for their progress towards the finalization of the first national action plan for its implementation. In this same context, another key milestone is the recent decision of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP) to open Case 11, which will address gender-based, sexual and reproductive violence by the parties to the conflict. I acknowledge the leadership and tireless work of hundreds of civil society organizations across Colombia who advocated for the opening of the case. This important development adds up to recent progress by the SJP on its way to issuing the first restorative sentences, including recent acknowledgements of responsibility made by all parties. Contributing to the truth and acknowledging responsibility are an obligation of all parties to the conflict and constitute fundamental pillars for the success of this process. As the Secretary-General stated in his report, promptly reaching the stage in which the SJP issues its first restorative sentences is important for the peace process as a whole. Likewise, for restorative sentences to fulfill their objective and thus honour the principle of the centrality of victims, it will be definitive that the Government guarantees that conditions are in place for their prompt and effective implementation. To this end, the Mission continues to work closely with the SJP, individuals under its jurisdiction, as well as with Government and State entities. Mr. President, Members of the Council, From conducting a participatory process to develop the national action plan for Security Council resolution 1325 alongside women platforms, to consultations with peasants and landowners over rural reform, dialogue with grassroots organizations has been a prevalent practice of the current administration. I salute this inclusive approach, which provides opportunities for building consensus on public policy. In that spirit, I encourage the Government, former FARC-EP combatants and all actors invested in the comprehensive implementation of the Final Peace Agreement to prioritize constructive dialogue. This will be essential for sustained progress in areas such as the ethnic chapter, the rural reform, reintegration as well as illicit crop substitution. Also critical to moving forward is the definition, without further delay, of a clear institutional architecture to oversee implementation, including the appointment of the high-level official within the Presidency tasked to lead these efforts. The period ahead will be key for translating new plans and initiatives into actions. Mr. President and Distinguished Members, In over two weeks, Colombia will hold its second local elections since the Final Agreement. Unfortunately, violence has already impacted the electoral campaign in various regions, and has affected parties across the political spectrum, including former combatants and members of the Comunes party. I trust that authorities will do their utmost to guarantee that both candidates and voters can participate in the elections in the most inclusive and secure way possible throughout the national territory. This would deepen a tangible outcome of the Final Agreement. Mr. President, Colombia’s conflict was once considered intractable. The peacebuilding efforts underway today with the crucial support of this Council, came about following frustrated attempts in previous decades. But Colombians never gave up on peace, and nor did the international community. In times of tensions around the world, Colombia’s case is a reminder that even the most entrenched of conflicts can be resolved through dialogue, and a call to never desist in the search for peace.

423384448,"We are halfway to the deadline set by the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals , our best and only chance of leaving the world better than we found it. While decades of progress have lifted more than a billion people out of poverty, COVID-19 and a series of geopolitical shocks have resulted in serious setbacks. But there’s still time to finish strongif we course correct. SDG 1, eliminating poverty in all its forms, is the all-access key. This year, as we mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty , we look at what poverty tells us about the state of the world and what it means for human dignity, and with a focus on quality jobs. But first, let’s strip 'no poverty'the bedrock of all the SDGsdown to its basics. “What IS poverty in all its forms?” Poverty isn’t just lack of money. It’s a trap. It’s poor health, sub-standard or no education, and lack of political power. It’s dangerous it often comes with unsafe housing and perilous working conditions. It’s unfair. The poor aren’t treated equally under justice systems and their healthcare is inferior.    This relentless cycle condemns billions, through no fault of their own, and often just by accident of birth and place of living, to hopelessness and insecurity. But having a job is not a guarantee of being out of poverty. According to the International Labour Organization, 13 percent of the world’s workers are moderately poor and 8 percent are in extreme poverty. Simply put And poor people are often treated unfairly in justice systems. UNDP supports justice for all, particularly for those living in poverty and the disadvantaged, including women, children, minorities, people with disabilities and those living with HIV/AIDS. In 34 countries, 32 million people have now realized their legal rights and protections. How does poverty harm the human family? Poverty is a dragging anchor that holds entire countries back, and worse. It weakens the social fabric. History provides plenty of examples of how quickly unequal societies flail and fall, often violently. One of the great changes in mindsets of recent decades is that we have recognized that poverty is not ‘natural’ or an inevitable fact of life. It’s the very unnatural outcome of failing to truly recognize, or care, that every human is equal in dignity and deserves the same opportunities. It is a byproduct of unjust biased laws, policies or institutions that deepen marginalization. In more than 30 countries, women and girls do not have the rights to inherit or own land. The World Bank says about 90 percent of the land in sub-Sahara Africa is undocumented. With about 80 percent of poor people live in rural areas, land titling could have a significant impact on poverty levels and food security.    We built the systems that created poverty, which means we can also take them down.    What is the quickest way to do this? Spoiler alert: It’s not rocket science. We know what works and we have done for a while. One thing we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic is that economic priorities are not set in stone. During the global health emergency, resources were quickly re-deployed to support social protection programmes that kept families and businesses afloat. At least in the countries that could afford it. In the last three years alone, more than 190 countries rolled out more than 3,333 social protection measures, with 73 percent of low-income countries and 66 percent of lower-middle-income countries relying on social assistance measures, mainly cash transfers. UNDP advocates for a Universal Basic Income , which has the potential to restore dignity and create a cushion against future shocks.    “A new social contract needs to emerge from this crisis that rebalances deep inequalities that are prevalent across societies. To put it bluntly: The question should no longer be whether resources for effective social protection can be found but how they can be found.” Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director for Asia and the Pacific.    showed how even a temporary basic income given to hundreds of millions of women would have stemmed the tide of rising poverty and inequality, particularly for women, during the COVID-19 pandemic. What does UNDP do? Ending poverty is at the top of UNDP’s priorities, and we look at the big and small picture. UNDP has long recognized the multidimensional aspects of poverty. For decades we have dug into the data to understand where people are poor and why. Our Multidimensional Poverty Index Report regularly updates data from 110 developing countries, with the aim of improving the lives of 6.1 billion people. Poverty gaps between women and men are particularly acute between the ages of 25 and 34, as women struggle to combine paid work with an unequal burden of care for families. For every 100 men in this age group who are poor, there are 122 women. UNDP’s Gender Equality Strategy shows that since the COVID-19 pandemic, women have been nearly twice as likely to lose their jobs than men. Yet fewer than 20 percent of policy responses across the world have addressed women’s economic insecurity. We know that no country has achieved full gender parity and less than 1 percent of women and girls live in a country with high women’s empowerment.    “At a time when progress towards achieving gender equality is often stalling or even reversing, this ambitious new Gender Equality Strategy will guide UNDP in its efforts to assist countries to move beyond piecemeal efforts towards portfolio approaches that shift power structures and the economic, social, and political systems that perpetuate discrimination.” Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.    We also know that small interventions can have a big effect, which is why we work with small business owners all over the world on almost every kind of issue. Whether it's in the Himalayas, creating alternative energy grids in sub-Saharan Africa, or working on land rights issues in Colombia, we create conditions that ensure women have the skills, resources and infrastructure to create their own wealth and to build businesses that benefit not just themselves but their communities and their natural environment. What does a world with no poverty look like? Let’s find out!    “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” Albert Einstein.    The greatest human minds have always been able to rise above the stale status quo to achieve true transformation in the way we see ourselves and our world. And we are at one such point in history where change is imperative. The SDGs are our big idea. Achieving each requires a shift in attitudes and priorities. The entire UN family is doubling down on its commitment to bring all of them across the finish line by 2030.    “This is not a time for incrementalism, this is a time for transformation with all hands on deck. Let’s get the SDGs back on track.” António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General",9367,halfway deadline set agenda sustainable development goals good chance leave world well find decade progress lift billion people poverty series geopolitical shock result setback time finish strongif course correct sdg eliminate poverty form access key year mark international day eradication poverty look poverty tell state world mean human dignity focus quality job let strip bedrock sdgsdown basic poverty form poverty lack money trap poor health sub standard education lack political power dangerous come unsafe housing perilous work condition unfair poor treat equally justice system healthcare inferior relentless cycle condemn billion fault accident birth place living hopelessness insecurity have job guarantee poverty accord international labour organization percent world worker moderately poor percent extreme poverty simply poor people treat unfairly justice system undp support justice particularly live poverty disadvantaged include woman child minority people disability live hiv aids country million people realize legal right protection poverty harm human family poverty drag anchor hold entire country bad weaken social fabric history provide plenty example quickly unequal society flail fall violently great change mindset recent decade recognize poverty natural inevitable fact life unnatural outcome fail truly recognize care human equal dignity deserve opportunity byproduct unjust biased law policy institution deepen marginalization country woman girl right inherit land world bank say percent land sub sahara africa undocumented percent poor people live rural area land titling significant impact poverty level food security build system create poverty mean quick way spoiler alert rocket science know work thing learn pandemic economic priority set stone global health emergency resource quickly deploy support social protection programme keep family business afloat country afford year country roll social protection measure percent low income country percent low middle income country rely social assistance measure mainly cash transfer undp advocate universal basic income potential restore dignity create cushion future shock new social contract need emerge crisis rebalance deep inequality prevalent society bluntly question long resource effective social protection find find kanni wignaraja un assistant secretary general undp director asia pacific show temporary basic income give hundred million woman stem tide rise poverty inequality particularly woman pandemic undp end poverty undp priority look big small picture undp long recognize multidimensional aspect poverty decade dig datum understand people poor multidimensional poverty index report regularly update datum develop country aim improve life billion people poverty gap woman man particularly acute age woman struggle combine pay work unequal burden care family man age group poor woman undp gender equality strategy show pandemic woman nearly twice likely lose job man few percent policy response world address woman economic insecurity know country achieve gender parity percent woman girl live country high woman empowerment time progress achieve gender equality stall reverse ambitious new gender equality strategy guide undp effort assist country piecemeal effort portfolio approach shift power structure economic social political system perpetuate discrimination achim steiner undp administrator know small intervention big effect work small business owner world kind issue himalayas create alternative energy grid sub saharan africa work land right issue colombia create condition ensure woman skill resource infrastructure create wealth build business benefit community natural environment world poverty look like let find solve problem thinking create albert einstein great human mind able rise stale status quo achieve true transformation way world point history change imperative sdg big idea achieve require shift attitude priority entire un family double commitment bring finish line time incrementalism time transformation hand deck let sdg track antónio guterres united nations secretary general

423391471,"Key Messages The recently concluded main season harvest is supporting Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes in northern surplus-producing areas of Zimbabwe, central and northern areas of Mozambique, Madagascar, and Malawi, and the northern province of DRC as households access food from their 2023 harvested stocks and income from crop sales. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are widespread in areas where poor household food stocks are gradually depleting, and households increasingly depend on market purchases where food prices remain largely higher than the five-year average. However, Crisis IPC (Phase 3) outcomes are present in parts of the region that recorded poor harvests following the impact of Tropical Cyclone Freddy and prolonged dry spells, particularly in southern Malawi, central and southern Mozambique, and parts of southern Zimbabwe, and conflict in eastern DRC. The return of IDPs in Cabo Delgado has improved accessibility by government and humanitarian organizations, driving Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Consumer price inflation in South Africa, Lesotho, and Mozambique continued its disinflationary trend in August as prices of staple commodities slowed. However, in Malawi, Angola, Madagascar, and the DRC, headline inflation has been increasing along with food inflation, which is expected to continue to negatively impact household purchasing power, particularly as market food purchases increase and food stocks decline. Fuel price inflation increased in August and will likely quicken in September after petrol and diesel prices increase. The recent increase in global oil prices will likely lead to higher agricultural input and transportation costs, with the region’s 2024 cereal crop planting seasons set to commence in October 2023. Following the conclusion of the 2023 harvest, poor households across Southern Africa are engaging in seasonal off-farm income-earning activities such as petty trade, casual labor and construction, producing and selling vegetables, firewood, and bricks, and artisanal mining to earn income. However, increased competition, poor liquidity among better-off households, and low demand for products and services are limiting poor household earnings. In the coming months, poor households are likely to increasingly engage in agricultural labor opportunities with the start of the 2023/24 agricultural southern-africa-kmu-2023-10 season. However, the ongoing strong El Niño will likely result in a delayed and erratic start to the rainy season, particularly in Zimbabwe, southern and central Mozambique, southern Malawi, and southern Madagascar. An erratic and delayed start will likely impact cropped areas and income-earning opportunities. Close monitoring of rainfall totals and distribution will be required to assess the severity of adverse impacts on cropping conditions for the 2023/24 harvest. Governments and donors should prepare now for rising food assistance needs in 2024. Based on historical trends during a strong El Niño, there is concern that acute malnutrition rates will likely rise across Southern Africa due to below-average harvests impacting household food availability and access, along with high staple food prices and limited income-earning opportunities for poor households. Lower-than-normal household purchasing power is also likely to impact household dietary diversity and food utilization negatively. In August 2023, UNICEF reported that 2023 severe acute malnutrition admission trends continue to be within the long-term average, with Zimbabwe and Angola recording slight declines in admission trends. However, during the 2016/17 El Niño, Zimbabwe recorded a 25 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition cases. Overall, a potential rise in acute malnutrition rates is likely to be exacerbated by inadequate access to treatment amid ongoing funding gaps.",9367,key messages recently conclude main season harvest support minimal ipc phase outcome northern surplus produce area zimbabwe central northern area mozambique madagascar malawi northern province drc household access food harvest stock income crop sale stressed ipc phase outcome widespread area poor household food stock gradually deplete household increasingly depend market purchase food price remain largely high year average crisis ipc phase outcome present part region record poor harvest follow impact tropical cyclone freddy prolong dry spell particularly southern malawi central southern mozambique part southern zimbabwe conflict eastern drc return idp cabo delgado improve accessibility government humanitarian organization drive stressed ipc phase outcome consumer price inflation south africa lesotho mozambique continue disinflationary trend august price staple commodity slow malawi angola madagascar drc headline inflation increase food inflation expect continue negatively impact household purchasing power particularly market food purchase increase food stock decline fuel price inflation increase august likely quicken september petrol diesel price increase recent increase global oil price likely lead high agricultural input transportation cost region cereal crop planting season set commence october follow conclusion harvest poor household southern africa engage seasonal farm income earn activity petty trade casual labor construction produce sell vegetable firewood brick artisanal mining earn income increase competition poor liquidity well household low demand product service limit poor household earning come month poor household likely increasingly engage agricultural labor opportunity start agricultural southern africa season ongoing strong el likely result delayed erratic start rainy season particularly zimbabwe southern central mozambique southern malawi southern madagascar erratic delay start likely impact crop area income earn opportunity close monitoring rainfall total distribution require assess severity adverse impact cropping condition harvest government donor prepare rise food assistance need base historical trend strong el concern acute malnutrition rate likely rise southern africa average harvest impact household food availability access high staple food price limited income earn opportunity poor household low normal household purchasing power likely impact household dietary diversity food utilization negatively august unicef report severe acute malnutrition admission trend continue long term average zimbabwe angola recording slight decline admission trend el zimbabwe record percent increase severe acute malnutrition case overall potential rise acute malnutrition rate likely exacerbate inadequate access treatment amid ongoing funding gap
423374803,"Le vendredi 8 septembre 2023, à 23 heures, un puissant séisme d'une magnitude de 6,8 sur l'échelle de Richter a frappé les montagnes de l'Atlas, à environ 70 kilomètres au sud de Marrakech, au Maroc, causant la mort d'environ 2900 personnes. Cet événement sismique a eu des répercussions significatives sur l'environnement bâti de la région. Bien que les chiffres exacts restent à déterminer, les premières indications montrent que près de 50 % du patrimoine bâti de la région a subi des dommages de diverses gravités, allant de légers dégâts à un effondrement structurel complet. En conséquence, plus de 50 % de la population de la zone exposée (soit plus de 400 000 personnes) a été directement touchée, et de nombreuses autres sont indirectement affectées. Cela se traduit par des personnes dormant à l'extérieur par crainte des répliques, hébergeant et soutenant d'autres familles, ainsi que par les fermetures de routes, les modifications des cours d'eau, les impacts sur l'agriculture et d'autres moyens de subsistance, etc. Pour aggraver les difficultés, de nombreuses communautés touchées se trouvent dans des régions montagneuses reculées difficiles d'accès, où l'hiver, qui approche rapidement, peut être rigoureux et accentuer l'isolement. CONSTATATIONS GENERALES. Les méthodes de construction dans la zone touchée varient considérablement, comprenant un mélange de systèmes de construction traditionnels en pierre/argile et de construction moderne en béton armé et maçonnerie confinée dans les villes plus importantes et les villages facilement accessibles à proximité. Les premières investigations sur le terrain n'ont montré aucune différence significative dans les performances sismiques des systèmes de construction traditionnels ou modernes. Les deux formes se sont bien comportées lorsqu'elles étaient correctement construites et ont échoué en cas de construction médiocre. Dans de nombreuses régions, le mélange improvisé de systèmes traditionnels et modernes a été l'une des principales causes de défaillance. Comme dans d'autres catastrophes similaires, l'équipe de Miyamoto a constaté la tendance de certains à blâmer le matériau de construction dominant plutôt que la qualité de la construction. Une croyance courante dans de nombreuses communautés touchées par un séisme dans le monde entier est que les anciens systèmes de construction traditionnels doivent être 'mauvais et faibles', tandis que les nouvelles techniques modernes telles que l'acier et le béton sont intrinsèquement 'meilleures', que la construction en béton est plus durable que la terre et la pierre. En réalité, le nombre de structures en béton endommagées et/ou effondrées constitue une preuve flagrante que la mauvaise qualité de la construction est la principale cause de défaillance, et non la confrontation entre les matériaux modernes et traditionnels. Les montagnes du Haut Atlas et les vallées environnantes sont sujettes aux séismes depuis des millénaires. Les techniques de construction traditionnelles locales ont évolué pour résister aux séismes grâce à des décennies d'essais et d'erreurs, en utilisant des matériaux abondants disponibles localement. Cependant, les systèmes de construction vernaculaires traditionnels nécessitent une analyse structurelle spécifique. Lorsque certaines techniques, telles que l'utilisation de roches plates avec un bon enchevêtrement et des murs épais de 50 cm, des poutres de toit traversant les murs et des fondations en roche solide, sont utilisées, les structures deviennent pratiquement indestructibles, se comportant bien lors des séismes, comme en témoignent de nombreuses structures en pierre bien construites et non endommagées dans les villages éloignés proches de l'épicentre. Cependant, il était évident que de bonnes pratiques avaient été perdues ou oubliées dans de nombreux bâtiments au fil du temps depuis le dernier séisme significatif, qui remontait à plus de 100 ans. Avec un si long intervalle entre les événements sismiques, une perception décroissante du risque a incité de nombreux propriétaires et entrepreneurs à prendre des raccourcis pour accélérer la construction et réduire la main-d'uvre. L'équipe de terrain de Miyamoto a toutefois rencontré de nombreux maîtres maçons locaux qui comprenaient instinctivement les bonnes pratiques et pouvaient clairement expliquer les causes du succès et de l'échec des structures traditionnelles. La construction moderne observée dans la zone touchée consistait principalement en un système de maçonnerie confinée avec des blocs de béton ou de la pierre avec un remplissage de boue. Ce système est bien défini dans de nombreux pays et, lorsqu'il est correctement construit, résiste exceptionnellement bien aux charges sismiques. En revanche, lorsqu'il est mal construit, les résultats peuvent être catastrophiques. En plus de nécessiter une formation appropriée, un défi majeur pour de nombreuses communautés éloignées est que des matériaux tels que du ciment de haute qualité, des agrégats fissurés de taille appropriée et de l'acier d'armature de qualité peuvent être peu économiques et/ou difficiles à obtenir et à transporter. L'adoption de techniques de construction modernes varie considérablement dans la zone touchée, semblant généralement être directement liée à la proximité de la communauté et à l'accès aux marchés urbains. Beaucoup de communautés situées à quelques heures de route des centres urbains semblent fonctionner davantage comme des banlieues satellites que comme des communautés agricoles rurales, de nombreux habitants évoquant leurs déplacements pour le travail, l'éducation ou les soins de santé. L'adoption de techniques de construction modernes dans ces communautés n'est pas seulement inévitable, mais aussi sensée, car les besoins en maind'uvre locale en construction rivalisent avec des emplois urbains mieux rémunérés, et l'accès à des matériaux modernes rend les options moins intensives en main-d'uvre plus viables. Cependant, dans les communautés plus éloignées des montagnes du Haut Atlas, l'architecture autochtone unique de la région est intrinsèquement liée à l'histoire et à la culture des habitants. La préservation de l'architecture intrinsèquement résistante aux séismes de ces régions pourrait également stimuler l'industrie touristique vitale dans des zones où le changement climatique et la migration urbaine rendent les moyens de subsistance traditionnels moins viables. Il est essentiel de capitaliser sur les connaissances des maîtres maçons de la région et de partager ces connaissances avec la population plus large de la région dans le cadre des efforts de reconstruction.",9367,le vendredi septembre à heure un puissant séisme magnitude de sur de richter frappé les montagne de à environ kilomètre au sud de marrakech au maroc causant la mort personne cet

SOLIDARITES INTERNATIONAL (SI) is an international humanitarian aid association which, since more than 40 years, has been providing assistance to populations affected by armed conflicts and natural disasters by meeting their basic needs for food, water and shelter. Particularly committed to the fight against diseases linked to unsafe water, the leading cause of death in the world, SI's interventions provide expertise in the field of access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene promotion, but also in the essential area of food security and livelihoods. Present in some twenty countries, the SI teams 2500 people in total, made up of expatriates, national staff, permanent staff at HQ, and a few volunteers - intervene with professionalism and commitment while respecting cultural norms. ABOUT THE MISSION. Following fighting between SAF (regular army) and RSF (rapid support forces) since April 2023, SI is developing a rapid emergency response in Sudan. In Geneina, West Darfur, SI opened a base in August 2022, providing assistance to IDPs living in the gathering sites inside the city. The response was WASH in emergency activities with water trucking, construction of boreholes, hygiene kits distribution, latrines construction and rehabilitation. Today, the situation in Darfur, and specifically in Geneina is worsening due to the conflict at country level. SI is assessing the sites and the needs for an emergency response which began in May 2023, providing WASH in emergency activities to the IDPs and host communities in Geneina, and possibly in other states in Darfur (El Fasher, Nyala). SI began water trucking activities in May 2023 and is the only WASH actor in Geneina. In the East of the country, especially Gedaref, Al Jazirah and Madani states, security situation is tense but much calmer than in Darfur. SI is doing assessments to implement a WASH/shelter and NFIs response for IDPs, mainly coming from Khartoum. In Khartoum, SI wants to develop a WASH emergency response as soon as possible, and when authorizations are provided. SI is one of the pillars of the INGO forum coordination, especially for Darfur.

423360483,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. Streamlining monitoring and reporting of country achievements is a major regional strategic objective for WHO. Our first report, Progress on the health-related sustainable development goals and targets in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2020 documented progress prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and identified key challenges to achieve these targets. This second report, Progress on the health-related sustainable development goals and targets in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2023 presents an update on country and regional trends using data available for 50 health-related indicators (across nine out of 17 SDGs) from January 2010 to June 2023. The 2023 progress report includes enhancements in the reporting of the health-related indicators from the 2020 report. In response to calls for improved monitoring of inequality, the 2023 report presents disaggregated data for a portion of the indicators. Further efforts have been made to affirm data sources and improve quality control so that a more detailed and accurate picture of regional progress can be presented. Despite WHO and country efforts to improve the quality and availability of data, lack of trend and disaggregated data continues to hamper the monitoring of progress on health-related SDGs at national and regional levels. Data on the health-related SDGs were compiled from several sources using countries’ validated data. United Nations agencies’ standardizations or estimates, the WHO Global Health Observatory and the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Health Observatory were the key sources. Regional mean values were obtained from the primary data sources whenever available or calculated using population-weighted approaches if there were at least 10 countries with data available for that indicator. Progress on the health-related SDG targets at both the regional and country levels shows an anticipated slow-down with setbacks across many indicators on health coverage, health risks, determinants and health status compared to the 2020 report. The slower progress is reflective of the negative impact of the pandemic, economic issues and ongoing complex emergencies faced by half the countries in the Region. Progress on most of the health coverage indicators has been too slow to meet the 2030 targets, although modest improvements were observed on mean coverage of health services, proportion of the population facing financial hardship due to high out-of-pocket payments, and density of health-care personnel. Progress slowed or stalled on health risk factors. A high proportion of children under 5 continue to face malnutrition. Minimal improvements have been made on environmental risks like air pollution, water and sanitation. Unchanged unemployment rates and the high proportion of children not achieving minimum reading proficiency are examples of determinants of health with available data that paint a bleak picture. The minimal progress on health coverage, health risks and determinants explains in part the stalled progress on three quarters of the morbidity and mortality indicators including maternal and child mortality rates, mortality rates due to NCDs and prevalence of key communicable diseases. Nevertheless, at the country level, successes do exist: since 2010, the under-5 mortality rate in the Region has decreased from 60 deaths per 1000 live births to 45 deaths per 1000 live births, mortality from NCDs has dropped by more than 15% in Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and the UHC Index has increased by 10 or more points in Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran and Qatar. As the most intense pandemic response phase came to an end, the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 outbreak and the strengthened public health commitment have once again allowed a shift towards crucial public health priorities, health system strengthening, essential health-care services and the enhancement of national health information systems. Country successes demonstrate possibilities and provide inspiration to build the momentum to address priorities that may have slipped off the radar during the pandemic. Large inter-country differences exist both in the current status and in the progress being made towards the SDGs across most indicators. The unavailability of data for around one in five indicators a quarter of data reported is from 2019 or earlier hinders progress reporting. At the same time, lack of disaggregated data impedes efforts to promote health equity through gender- and equity-sensitive policies and programmes. This limited data disaggregation by age, sex, place of residence and other variables is a major barrier to generating information through a gender and equity lens to inform public health action and “leave no one behind”. Improving the availability of disaggregated data would allow us to monitor and guide relevant evidence-informed policy changes and implementation to address inequities. These perspectives demonstrate the need for more and stronger action for better results. Achieving the health-related SDGs requires bold action across four areas: (i) advancing universal health coverage by investing in quality, accessible and integrated health services over the life- course; (ii) adopting an all-hazards, whole-of- government approach to public health preparedness and response; (iii) addressing health risks and determinants by promoting comprehensive multisectoral coordination policies and mechanisms to adopt and implement; and (iv) expanding evidence-based and data and research-informed gender- and equity-sensitive policy-making. These measures are not new: they were spelled out in the 2020 report as well as in previous decisions of WHO governing bodies by the Member States and the Secretariat. Despite disrupting progress, the COVID-19 crisis has also presented an opportunity to propel the SDG agenda forward by underlining the necessity for stronger, more collaborative governance as well as demanding the exploration and use of novel approaches. Though current indicators may not reflect the anticipated progress, the pandemic has instilled resilience and enabled the mobilization of resources that can now be redirected to addressing other health-related matters contributing to the attainment of the SDGs. Together, it is possible to accelerate progress toward the health-related SDGs in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, for example through joint United Nations platforms such as the Regional Health Alliance, and to achieve health for all by all.",9367,executive summary streamline monitoring reporting country achievement major regional strategic objective report progress health relate sustainable development goal target eastern mediterranean region document progress prior pandemic identify key challenge achieve target second report progress health relate sustainable development goal target eastern mediterranean region present update country regional trend datum available health relate indicator sdg january june progress report include enhancement reporting health relate indicator report response call improved monitoring inequality report present disaggregate datum portion indicator effort affirm data source improve quality control detailed accurate picture regional progress present despite country effort improve quality availability datum lack trend disaggregate datum continue hamper monitoring progress health relate sdg national regional level datum health relate sdg compile source country validate datum united nations agency standardization estimate global health observatory eastern mediterranean regional health observatory key source regional mean value obtain primary datum source available calculate population weight approach country datum available indicator progress health relate sdg target regional country level show anticipated slow setback indicator health coverage health risk determinant health status compare report slow progress reflective negative impact pandemic economic issue ongoing complex emergency face half country region progress health coverage indicator slow meet target modest improvement observe mean coverage health service proportion population face financial hardship high pocket payment density health care personnel progress slow stall health risk factor high proportion child continue face malnutrition minimal improvement environmental risk like air pollution water sanitation unchanged unemployment rate high proportion child achieve minimum reading proficiency example determinant health available datum paint bleak picture minimal progress health coverage health risk determinant explain stall progress quarter morbidity mortality indicator include maternal child mortality rate mortality rate ncd prevalence key communicable disease country level success exist mortality rate region decrease death live birth death live birth mortality ncds drop oman qatar saudi arabia uhc index increase point egypt islamic republic iran qatar intense pandemic response phase come end lesson learn outbreak strengthened public health commitment allow shift crucial public health priority health system strengthen essential health care service enhancement national health information system country success demonstrate possibility provide inspiration build momentum address priority slip radar pandemic large inter country difference exist current status progress sdg indicator unavailability datum indicator quarter datum report early hinder progress reporting time lack disaggregate data impede effort promote health equity equity sensitive policy programme limited data disaggregation age sex place residence variable major barrier generate information gender equity lens inform public health action leave improve availability disaggregate datum allow monitor guide relevant evidence inform policy change implementation address inequity perspective demonstrate need strong action well result achieve health relate sdg require bold action area advance universal health coverage invest quality accessible integrated health service course ii adopt hazard government approach public health preparedness response iii address health risk determinant promote comprehensive multisectoral coordination policy mechanism adopt implement iv expand evidence base datum research inform equity sensitive policy making measure new spell report previous decision govern body member states secretariat despite disrupt progress crisis present opportunity propel sdg agenda forward underline necessity strong collaborative governance demand exploration use novel approach current indicator reflect anticipated progress pandemic instill resilience enable mobilization resource redirect address health relate matter contribute attainment sdg possible accelerate progress health relate sdg eastern mediterranean region example joint united nations platform regional health alliance achieve health

423313790,"Geneva/Beirut/Benghazi, 11 October 2023 *---* One month after devastating floods struck Libya, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Libyan Red Crescent Society (LRCS) are urgently calling for support to meet immediate needs in clean water, sanitation, cash assistance, and crucially, psychosocial support. The floods have wreaked havoc, displaced thousands and straining already fragile infrastructures in regions such as Derna and Tobruk. The disaster led to overwhelming destruction, with people losing homes, family members, and their sense of security. Libyan Red Crescent Society teams were the first responders, providing vital services from search and rescue to first aid. To date, 450 dedicated volunteers have been actively involved in these efforts, some even losing their lives while saving others. Tamer Ramadan, IFRC Head of Delegation in Libya, said: 'The emotional and physical toll of this disaster has been immense. While we have been diligent in our immediate response, the recovery process is far from over. Attention must not wane.' In Libya, the focus of aid is not just immediate relief but also long-term recovery. Cultural norms favor financial autonomy; hence cash assistance is essential. Furthermore, with damaged sewerage systems contaminating water sources in Derna, there's a heightened risk to community health. Teams are also focusing on providing holistic psychosocial support, especially given the emotional toll of losing entire families. The LRCS has been indispensable in relief efforts. With a central emergency operation room in Benghazi and two temporary centers in Derna, their services range from family reunification to relief item distribution. They've supported over 54,000 people through various services to date. In light of the escalating needs, IFRC has officially launched an appeal for 10 million Swiss francs to support the ongoing efforts of LRCS in providing comprehensive aid and care for survivors. As of now, 3 million Swiss francs have been raised, leaving a crucial 70 percent of funding appeal yet to be met. Donations can be made through participating national societies and directly via the IFRC website. More information.

423330783,"Attachments (Dar-es-Salaam/Addis, 11th October 2023) The 2nd International Conference on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is underway in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, from October 9th to 11th, under the theme “Change in a Generation.” World Vision commends the African Union and the Government of the Republic of Tanzania for hosting this crucial event, which also coincides with the International Day of the Girl. The conference aims to assess progress made in eliminating FGM in Africa, where 160 million women and girls have undergone the practice that is prevalent in parts of West, East, Central, and Northern Africa. The urgency to end FGM has gained momentum, with international, regional, national and local organisations, including youth and child activists, calling for an immediate elimination of this harmful practice. “It's violence against children and no girl should go through FGM particularly because it violates their rights and takes away their childhood” reminisces Tenema, Sierra Leone. The United Nations and the African Union recognises FGM as a violation of girls’ rights and have endorsed initiatives like the AU Saleema Initiative and the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation to eliminate this harmful practice. Article 5 of the Maputo Protocol strongly condemns all forms of abuse against women and girls, emphasising legislative measures and sanctions to eradicate harmful practices.    “States Parties shall prohibit and condemn all forms of harmful practices which negatively affect the human rights of women and which are contrary to recognised international standards. States Parties shall take all necessary legislative and other measures to eliminate such practices, including: prohibition, through legislative measures backed by sanctions, of all forms of female genital mutilation, scarification, medicalisation and para-medicalisation of female genital mutilation and all other practices in order to eradicate them” Maputo protocol on Women’s Rights.    World Vision recognises the severe physical and psychological consequences of FGM on girls and women, including pain, infections, and complications during childbirth. FGM also deprives girls of their rights to education and bodily integrity. “It is easier to get transmitted diseases such as HIV during an act of cutting as they use the same razor blade or knife for all girls, I am grateful to my aunt who saved me from being married and circumcised” according to a girl from Simanjiro, Tanzania. Female Genital Mutilation persists due to gender inequality and entrenched cultural beliefs, often preceding child marriage. Despite being illegal in many countries, economic, social and cultural pressures force girls and young women into this practice. Turning the tide on child marriage and FGM requires a multi-sector approach to create lasting change, as such World vision through it’s Big Dream Project is working to address this. The approach follows the WHO’s evidence-based strategies for best practices in child protection work. The Big Dream changes social norms harmful to children, empowers parents and caregivers with knowledge and skills to enable them take daily sustainable actions for (i) protecting children from physical and sexual violence, child marriage, FGM, and other forms of violence against children, (ii) strengthens household economic conditions to reduce financial incentives for child marriage, (iii) promotes education and life skills training for girls. The three-pronged approach reinforces the role of the family and community leaders, sustainable family incomes and the importance of education. Progress has been made in recent years in the fight against FGM. The practice is declining fast among girls aged 15 to 19 in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Liberia and Togo among other countries, which is very commendable. Despite the large number of laws that ban FGM, prosecutions are rare, and there is limited information available on prosecutions or the outcomes of any prosecutions made in recent years. World Vision calls for ; Urgent action at the 2nd International FGM conference, emphasising the need for collective resolve and commitment from State Parties, aligning with the African Union Agenda 2063 aspiration of a people-driven Africa that safeguards women, youth, and children by ending all forms of gender-based violence, especially FGM. Accelerated efforts and investments in girls’ education in line with the African continental strategy for education; Enforcing existing legislation and policies banning FGM particularly, efforts to contain crossborder FGM; Support families with economic opportunities and implement social protection policies where they exist.

423326256,"SITUATION OVERVIEW. On Friday (6 October), Security Council members held their 17th annual joint consultative meeting with members of the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The meeting opened with a discussion on the situation in Sudan and regional ramifications of the crisis and called for peace and stability in the region. On 5 October, the Sudanese Foreign Minister rejected the draft resolution presented before the UN Human Rights Council’s (HRC) 54th session in Geneva to establish an independent investigation mechanism to investigate human rights violations in Sudan. The draft was said to lack objectivity and fairness. Minister of Finance and Economic Planning reportedly confirmed reaching an understanding with international funding institutions to support the funding of essential services in Sudan (education, health, water and other basic services). On 3 October, Lt. General al-Burhan met with representative of the National Mechanism to Support Democratic Civil Transition led by former Sovereignty Council member Aisha Musa. The mechanism’s vision is to restore a peaceful, civil and democratic path in Sudan in consultation with national stakeholders. The leader of the National Umma Party announced a three-day visit to the United Arab Emirates to discuss ending the wat and support for the Jeddah process. Meanwhile, Kenyan President, William Ruto met with IGAD Executive Secretary to discuss a coordinated approach in supporting the resolution of the conflict in Sudan. Heavy fighting and air strikes continue to be reported in Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri without any indication of a possible cessation of hostilities; heavy shelling was reported in the residential neighbourhood of Omdurman. Fighting has also reportedly extended to neighbouring areas to Aj Jazirah State. In Darfur, the Armed Signatory Movements (ASM) are seeking to increase presence and mobilize further personnel in effort to protect civilians and aid the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance. Increased RSF mobilization efforts are also being reported around El Genina, West Darfur, where the situation remains tense with a possible renewal of fighting. In South Darfur, fighting between the warring parties continued, a situation further exacerbated by on-going inter-communal tensions between the Beni Halba and Salamat communities and heavy rains and flooding. In Central Darfur sporadic fighting was reported around Zalingei and Hassahissa IDP camp which continues to be impacted by RSF artillery fire. In North Kordofan, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was reported in El Obeid and in its proximity. In response to the RSF’s claims over Wad Ashana last week, an increase of SAF deployments in Kosti and around the Rabak-Kosti bridge, White Nile were reported. In South Kordofan, clashes between SAF and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement North/Al Hilu (SPLMN/AH) also continued across various locations. IOM’s DTM also reported attacks by the RSF on the El Fakharin village in Abassiya locality in South Kordofan, which has led to the displacement of nearly 280 households, most of which are currently sheltering in villages within the same locality. DTM Sudan estimates that 4,551,795 individuals (907,833 households) have been recently internally displaced. The IDP caseload has been observed in 4,647 locations across all of Sudan’s 18 states. The highest proportions of IDPs have been observed in River Nile (12.66%), South Darfur (11.19%), East Darfur (11.01%), Aj Jazirah (8.07%), Northern (7.97%), and North Darfur (7.37%). Field teams report that the IDPs observed were originally displaced from 8 states. The majority (3,120,044 IDPs, 68.55%) have been reportedly displaced from Khartoum state; followed by South Darfur (14.58%), North Darfur (7.97%), Central Darfur (3.99%), West Darfur (3.75%), South Kordofan (0.72%), North Kordofan (0.43%), and Aj Jazirah (0.01%). DTM Sudan also estimates that approximately 2.63% of the IDP caseload are non-Sudanese nationals. In addition to the internal displacement, the conflict in Sudan has caused the mixed cross-border movements of 1,237,103 individuals into neighbouring countries namely Egypt, Libya, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia. 65% of arrivals tracked in those countries were Sudanese nationals and 35% estimated foreign nationals and returnees. The majority of arrivals were reported in Chad (40.5%), Egypt (26.1%), and South Sudan (24.6%). The recent statement published by the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Ms. Clementine Nkweta-Salami, highlights Sudan as the world’s fastest-growing displacement crisis. While outlining the complex and overlapping challenges faced by displaced and host populations, the statement highlighted the need for additional funding to continue the provision of critical assistance to affected populations.",9367,situation overview friday october security council member hold annual joint consultative meeting member african union peace security council aupsc addis ababa ethiopia meeting open discussion situation sudan regional ramification crisis call peace stability region october sudanese foreign minister reject draft resolution present un human rights council hrc session geneva establish independent investigation mechanism investigate human right violation sudan draft say lack objectivity fairness minister finance economic planning reportedly confirm reach understanding international funding institution support funding essential service sudan education health water basic service october lt general al burhan meet representative national mechanism support democratic civil transition lead sovereignty council member aisha musa mechanism vision restore peaceful civil democratic path sudan consultation national stakeholder leader national umma party announce day visit united arab emirates discuss end wat support jeddah process kenyan president william ruto meet igad executive secretary discuss coordinated approach support resolution conflict sudan heavy fighting air strike continue report khartoum omdurman bahri indication possible cessation hostility heavy shelling report residential neighbourhood omdurman fighting reportedly extend neighbouring area aj jazirah state darfur armed signatory movements asm seek increase presence mobilize personnel effort protect civilian aid delivery essential humanitarian assistance increase rsf mobilization effort report el genina west darfur situation remain tense possible renewal fighting south darfur fight war party continue situation exacerbate go inter communal tension beni halba salamat community heavy rain flooding central darfur sporadic fighting report zalingei hassahissa idp camp continue impact rsf artillery fire north kordofan fight sudanese armed forces saf rapid support forces rsf report el obeid proximity response rsf claim wad ashana week increase saf deployment kosti rabak kosti bridge white nile report south kordofan clash saf sudan people liberation movement north al hilu splmn ah continue location iom dtm report attack rsf el fakharin village abassiya locality south kordofan lead displacement nearly household currently shelter village locality dtm sudan estimate individual household recently internally displace idp caseload observe location sudan state high proportion idp observe river nile south darfur east darfur aj jazirah northern north darfur field team report idps observe originally displace state majority idp reportedly displace khartoum state follow south darfur north darfur central darfur west darfur south kordofan north kordofan aj jazirah dtm sudan estimate approximately idp caseload non sudanese national addition internal displacement conflict sudan cause mixed cross border movement individual neighbouring country egypt libya chad central african republic south sudan ethiopia arrival track country sudanese national estimate foreign national returnee majority arrival report chad egypt south sudan recent statement publish deputy special representative secretary general resident humanitarian coordinator sudan clementine nkweta salami highlight sudan world fast grow displacement crisis outline complex overlapping challenge face displace host population statement highlight need additional funding continue provision critical assistance affect population

423318297,"One week after the release of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation Laudate Deum, faith leaders around the world are endorsing support for a Loss and Damage Fund to mitigate the detrimental and unjust impacts of climate change already affecting the poor. Many Global South nations contribute the least to the climate crisis, yet pay the heaviest price of other nations’ operations. At COP28 (November 30 December 12), faith leaders will deliver a statement calling on world leaders to protect the poor and work towards true climate justice. “Solidarity demands urgent action by those with means and responsibility. A Loss and Damage Fund that genuinely meets the needs of people at the frontlines of the climate emergency is not just a responsibility; it is an undeniable moral imperative,” says President of Caritas Internationalis Msgr. Archbishop Isao Kikuchi. Loss and Damage refers to the impacts of climate change that are already being experienced around the world, especially by people in the Global South. Following the global climate talks at COP27 in Egypt last year, a breakthrough decision was reached to establish a Loss and Damage Fund for communities suffering from the current climate emergency. Senior Vatican representatives, faith based groups from climate vulnerable countries and diverse stakeholders all contributed to the discussions held at COP27, and particularly reflected on the moral case for action on Loss and Damage. According to the UNHCR, more than 20 million people are forced to leave their homes due to extreme weather events including sea-level rise, prolonged droughts and severe flooding, and environmental degradation. Caritas Internationalis and SCIAF (Caritas Scotland), together with CIDSE and the Laudato Si’ Movement, believe that there is a deep disharmony at the heart of the climate crisis which is hurting our poorest brothers and sisters the most. “A Loss and Damage fund should not just be symbolic, but one that supports those who bear the brunt of the climate crisis. In the face of the escalating climate crisis, this commitment to fairness and accountability should serve as the cornerstone of efforts. Let us rally together in solidarity and purpose!” says Alistair Dutton, Secretary General of Caritas Internationalis. The final details of the Loss and Damage Fund will be agreed at COP28 in Dubai later this year, and faith leaders will deliver their statement in support of a fit-for-purpose fund to protect the poor which: gets money to the people who need it the most; is adequately resourced based on the polluter-pays principle; fully addresses non-economic losses and damages; and corrects the injustice of poorer nations paying the price of other nations’ actions. The urgency to act is growing every day and the price for our lifestyles is already being paid by those who have contributed the least to the climate disaster. “The Loss and Damage fund is simply a matter of justice and recognition of responsibility. What’s needed now is the courage to take the decisions and make the fund and mechanisms a reality,” says Josianne Gauthier, Secretary General of CIDSE. In light of the realities of the climate crisis, Tomás Insua, Executive Director of the Laudato Si’ Movement, calls for shared vision for the future based on justice and compassion: “Let us be the generation that rises above indifference, challenges the status quo, and paves the way for true solidarity with the Loss and Damage Fund.” Endorse the Loss and Damage Fund statement here:",9367,week release pope francis apostolic exhortation laudate deum faith leader world endorse support loss damage fund mitigate detrimental unjust impact climate change affect poor global south nation contribute climate crisis pay heavy price nation operation november december faith leader deliver statement call world leader protect poor work true climate justice solidarity demand urgent action mean responsibility loss damage fund genuinely meet need people frontline climate emergency responsibility undeniable moral imperative say president caritas internationalis msgr archbishop isao kikuchi loss damage refer impact climate change experience world especially people global south follow global climate talk egypt year breakthrough decision reach establish loss damage fund community suffer current climate emergency senior vatican representative faith base group climate vulnerable country diverse stakeholder contribute discussion hold particularly reflect moral case action loss damage accord unhcr million people force leave home extreme weather event include sea level rise prolong drought severe flooding environmental degradation caritas internationalis sciaf caritas scotland cidse laudato si movement believe deep disharmony heart climate crisis hurt poor brother sister loss damage fund symbolic support bear brunt climate crisis face escalate climate crisis commitment fairness accountability serve cornerstone effort let rally solidarity purpose say alistair dutton secretary general caritas internationalis final detail loss damage fund agree dubai later year faith leader deliver statement support fit purpose fund protect poor get money people need adequately resource base polluter pay principle fully address non economic loss damage correct injustice poor nation pay price nation action urgency act grow day price lifestyle pay contribute climate disaster loss damage fund simply matter justice recognition responsibility need courage decision fund mechanism reality say josianne gauthier secretary general cidse light reality climate crisis tomás insua executive director laudato si movement call share vision future base justice compassion let generation rise indifference challenge status quo pave way true solidarity loss damage fund endorse loss damage fund statement
423318573,"Attachments Across Africa, most migration takes place within the continent, and this is particularly true for sub-Saharan Africa.7 In 2022, the migratory landscape in the East and Horn of Africa (EHoA) region remained largely fluid and complex in nature.8 While forced migration continued to drive the main movement trends within and across countries, the overall drivers of mobility have become more mixed and inextricably intertwined. By the end of the year, the region hosted a very large population of internally displaced persons (IDPs 9.6 million) and refugees and asylum-seekers (3.8 million) due to widespread conflict and violence, political persecution, human rights violations, climatic events and harsh environmental conditions.9. Most of the international migrant stock hosted in the region is constituted of refugees and asylum-seekers, with refugee movements primarily taking place within the region. As a result, the EHoA hosts a slightly higher number of female than male migrants, which is a unique characteristic compared to other parts of the continent and to global trends. Women and girls tend to represent the largest share of the refugee population, while men and boys tend to dominate labour migration dynamics. Well-established formal and informal labour migration corridors are present across the region, wherein labour demand in destination countries remains the key structural determinant of the mobility landscape. Saudi Arabia, together with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, continues to attract large volumes of migrants, mostly female domestic workers, including through formalized recruitment channels, whereas men are mainly engaged in agriculture and herding and move in an irregular manner. Meanwhile, South Africa continues to shape the migration aspirations of people in search of the “Southern Dream” through an established economic system with successful diasporas that act as both catalyser and safety net for the migrant population. While the full extent of the COVID-19 impact on international migration is still unclear, the EHoA is predicted to have more individuals emigrating from the region than individuals immigrating to the region in the coming years. International migration will continue to affect population growth, yet its contribution will not lead the growth process, which will still be driven by natural change (or the balance of births over deaths). One of the major events leading global headlines in 2022 was the longest and most severe drought critically affecting parts of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. Largely impacting agropastoral communities, the drought devastated their main sources of livelihood and strained their resilience to climate change. New and varied mobility patterns were adopted to cope with this climate shock, including split-household arrangements whereby some members of the same household stayed in the country of origin and some migrated, often at short distance. These new patterns also included involuntary immobility for those with depleted livelihood assets who were unable to move elsewhere. The large-scale impact of the drought was so profound that internal displacements (or flows) caused by disasters in the region more than doubled in the past year, moving from contributing to around 20 per cent of all displacements in 2021 to 50 per cent in 2022.10 By the end of 2022, 36.6 million people were affected by drought, 2.7 million were displaced and 5.7 million IDPs were living in affected areas.11. In parallel with climate events, conflict and violence also persisted in different parts of the region, mainly across Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan. The signing of the northern Ethiopia peace deal in early November 2022 has brought new hope for reduced tensions and unhindered humanitarian access to the conflict-affected regions of Tigray, Amhara and Afar.12 Despite this step towards peace and stability, tensions continued in other parts of Ethiopia while national and localized conflicts were widespread in Somalia and South Sudan, fuelling displacement and driving humanitarian needs through 2022. The volatility of the conflict environment in the region and in neighbouring countries characterizes the EHoA as a critical humanitarian context where compounding crises are making resources scarcer to meet the needs of the affected populations. In 2022, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in the region reached 43.8 million, a record high that represents 28 per cent of the corresponding regional population.13. Conflict and climate events, along with the macroeconomic challenges faced by the region, have not reduced the will to migrate. On the contrary, in 2022, a major shift characterized by the full resumption of mixed migration trends across key migratory routes in the region was observed, thus marking the end of the impact of COVID-19 on mobility. Significant flows resumed along the Eastern Route from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula which also saw substantial forced and spontaneous returns, mostly to Ethiopia and Somalia. More importantly, data pointed to how climate shocks and persistent conflict and violence across the region are also affecting extraregional migration dynamics, as highlighted by the increase in these drivers across the Horn and upon arrival in Yemen. While still predominantly economic in nature due to widespread unemployment, land shortages and lack of opportunities at home, migration drivers along the Eastern Corridor became increasingly mixed and intertwined in 2022. Protection concerns were still high along this route, as well as along the Southern and Northern Corridors, given that migrants continued to use multiple smuggler networks with limited awareness of the risks that these perilous journeys entail, while often being deceived about their length and costs. Nonetheless, despite a misconception that most people in this region move irregularly, migration from Africa is largely regular and comparatively little migration from the continent is via irregular channels towards Europe or GCC and Middle Eastern countries.14. The A Region on the Move report series for the EHoA, which has been the regional flagship publication since 2017, aims to improve the regional migration evidence base for good migration governance in support of sustainable development and effective humanitarian action. Over the years, the report series has illustrated the main humanitarian situations, with a focus on internal displacement and mixed migration flows along the major migration corridors of this region. A Region on the Move 2022, the tenth report in the series, features limited updates from official data sources, such as estimates on international migrants, labour migration statistics and data on trafficking in persons, which were still being consolidated at the global and continental level at the time of writing this report. However, this edition provides new insights into population estimates, net migration, and return and reintegration, while expanding on the deaths and disappearances of people on the move. This report provides an advanced understanding of the main migrant groups and the environment in which mobility takes place; therefore, Chapter 1 opens with an overview of regional data and trends on international migrants and continues with a discussion of specific migrant groups including refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs and migrant workers as well as trends on international remittances. Given the predominant humanitarian nature of the EHoA migratory landscape, Chapter 2 delves deeper into the subject of internal displacement, which is largely driven by conflict, violence and climate shocks. Finally, Chapter 3 examines mixed movement trends along the main migration corridors in this region, which are generally irregular, with particular attention to migrants’ varying needs, profiles, challenges and vulnerabilities, including an analysis of assisted return trends and reintegration challenges. The report concludes with the Migration Outlook where the main drivers shaping future mobility trends are discussed to provide an indication of the most likely scenario for the region in the short and medium term.",9367,attachment africa migration take place continent particularly true sub saharan migratory landscape east horn africa ehoa region remain largely fluid complex force migration continue

423317297,"Climate finance announced in today’s Budget “doesn’t go far enough” to meet Ireland’s UNFCCC obligations. Trócaire has welcomed the additional €60 million allocated in Official Development Assistance (ODA) in today’s Budget, but warned much higher increases are needed given the scale of humanitarian crises and for the Government to meet its commitment to spend 0.7% of Gross National Income on ODA by 2030. Trócaire CEO, Caoimhe de Barra, said: “Investment in global humanitarian and development needs is vital given intensifying crises globally. Protracted conflict and violence, political instability, economic crises, along with climate impacts, mean that overseas aid is more critical than ever for millions of people living in poverty globally, particularly women who bear the brunt of these crises.” Ms de Barra added that the climate finance announced in today’s Budget “doesn’t go far enough” to meet Ireland’s UNFCCC obligations. “It is the world’s most marginalised people who are suffering the most due to the failure of global political leadership to act with urgency on the climate crisis and also due to decades of broken promises on overseas aid and international climate finance,” Ms de Barra said. Ms de Barra called on the Government to urgently deliver on its commitment to provide €225 million per annum of international climate finance, at a minimum, with a view to rapidly increasing this allocation in the context of actual needs of developing countries and in line with Ireland’s fair share of climate finance. Latest figures show that €99.6 million was delivered in climate finance in 2021. Ms de Barra said: “Given the rapid pace of climate breakdown, there is a real need to ensure that climate finance is additional to overseas aid and that there is full transparency. Otherwise, there is a risk of simply re-labelling existing aid as climate finance, rather than allocating additional funds.” “We have seen the stark picture of climate breakdown this year, including the devastating drought in the Horn of Africa and Cyclone Freddy in Malawi. This requires additional commitments on loss and damage finance for Global South countries.” “Along with a new global goal for climate finance need in the near future, the existing climate finance commitment by Ireland will need to dramatically increase in coming years this is part of Ireland’s agreed obligation as a richer country that has disproportionately contributed to global excess emissions.”",9367,climate finance announce today budget far meet ireland unfccc obligation trócaire welcome additional million allocate official development assistance oda today budget warn high increase need give scale humanitarian crisis government meet commitment spend gross national income oda trócaire ceo caoimhe de barra say investment global humanitarian development need vital give intensify crisis globally protract conflict violence political instability economic crisis climate impact mean overseas aid critical million people live poverty globally particularly woman bear brunt crisis ms de barra add climate finance announce today budget far meet ireland unfccc obligation world marginalise people suffer failure global political leadership act urgency climate crisis decade broken promise overseas aid international climate finance ms de barra say ms de barra call government urgently deliver commitment provide million annum international climate finance minimum view rapidly increase allocation context actual need develop country line ireland fair share climate finance late figure million deliver climate finance ms de barra say give rapid pace climate breakdown real need ensure climate finance additional overseas aid transparency risk simply labelling exist aid climate finance allocate additional fund see stark picture climate breakdown year include devastating drought horn africa cyclone freddy malawi require additional commitment loss damage finance global south country new global goal climate finance need near future exist climate finance commitment ireland need dramatically increase come year ireland agree obligation rich country disproportionately contribute global excess emission
423352622,"The drying trend intensifies through October and November, reaching its peak in January of the year following an El Niño event. During this period, rainfall in the western Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) can be as much as 50-60 per cent below the average from January through April. Based on these predictions, it is anticipated that FSM will face severe drought conditions in the first quarter of 2024, especially El Niño is officially declared by the end of September 2023 [...] The Micronesia Red Cross Society (MRCS) is currently gathering data to assess the impact of this slow-onset disaster. However, the urgency to mobilize resources and stocks to meet future needs is evident. The trigger for requesting a Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) is the potential severity of the situation, including escalated drought and cyclone risks, the islands' vulnerability, and logistical challenges. Therefore, prompt readiness actions are crucial, focusing on resource mobilization and strategic planning to alleviate expected hardships. Once the country officially acknowledges the drought situation, upgrading the imminent IFRC-DREF to a full-response IFRC-DREF will be imperative to safeguard communities and ensure sustainability in these challenging times. Once MRCS receives more data to confirm the impact of this slow-onset disaster, it will start to mobilise resources and stocks to cater for future emerging needs. To fully respond to the effects of this drought, this will be confirmed once the effects are visible, and the country is declared in a drought situation where this imminent IFRC-DREF will then be upgraded to a full response IFRC-DREF.

Total humanitarian food assistance needs across FEWS NET-monitored countries in April 2024 are projected to be: Similar to needs in Apr. 2023. Higher than the five-year average. This brief summarizes FEWS NET’s projection of the population in need of urgent food assistance and the severity of anticipated acute food insecurity in FEWS NET-monitored countries seven months into the future. The projected size of each country’s population experiencing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and higher) is compared to last year and the recent five-year average, categorized as Higher, Similar, or Lower. Additional information is provided for countries with large food insecure populations, an expectation of high severity, or where other key issues warrant further context. Analytical confidence is lower in FEWS NET’s remotely monitored countries, indicated by “RM.” Visit    for detailed country reports. FEWS NET defines the total PIN of urgent humanitarian food assistance as the combined number of people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity outcomes, regardless of whether they are receiving assistance, plus any populations in lower IPC Phases who would likely be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse in the absence of humanitarian food assistance.

423326795,"ABUJA, NIGERIA, 11 October - Every year on October 11, the world unites to celebrate the resilience, strength, and potential of girls, highlighting the distinct challenges they face worldwide. As we approach the midpoint of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) journey, the focus on the well-being and rights of all, especially girls, becomes even more critical. Despite the strides made, the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2023 indicates a sobering 131 years before we achieve full gender parity. The current global landscape, marked by resistance to gender equality and multifaceted crises, has further jeopardized the rights of adolescent girls, putting the vision of a just world for all at risk. UNICEF Representative in Nigeria Ms. Cristian Munduate said, 'The potential of our girls is limitless, but we must first provide them with the platforms to express, learn, and thrive. Our commitment to this cause is unwavering and paramount for the nation's progress.'* She further added, *'In a rapidly evolving world, the dreams and aspirations of our adolescent girls are the beacons that can guide our efforts towards a more inclusive, equitable future.' In Nigeria, the stakes are high for an estimated 26 million adolescent girls (ages 10-19). To ensure Nigeria remains on course for the 2030 SDGs, the spotlight must shine brightest on its girls, especially those marginalized due to disability, poverty, or crises, and those who are pregnant, parenting, or married. Our collective responsibility extends to championing girls’ education, preventing harmful cultural practices, advancing menstrual hygiene, offering tailored health services, and meeting the nutritional requirements of these young ladies. While the terrain might be fraught with challenges, there's hope. Nigeria’s adolescent girls are not passive bystanders but active agents of change, driving transformative initiatives in their communities. The time has come for their voices to echo louder in the halls of decision-making. Girls from UNICEF’s programme in Katsina and Sokoto, for instance, have put forth actionable demandsranging from life skills training and accessible digital devices to the critical involvement of fathers in girls' education. On this International Day of the Girl, UNICEF Nigeria calls for renewed vigor in safeguarding and fostering the rights of adolescent girls.

423354034,"October 11, 2023, Mogadishu, Somalia -Top officials from the country offices of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Federal Government of Somalia, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) joined efforts today to commemorate the International Day of the Girl Child. The event was designed to amplify the rights and potential of Somali girls, emphasizing their importance and the need to empower them. The high-level event convened over 200 participants in Mogadishu, including government leaders, UN representatives, youth activists, civil society groups, community elders, journalists, and development partners. In opening remarks, Deputy Minister Abdihakim Jimale Aden reiterated the government’s strong commitment to tackling persistent human rights issues like child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM) and lack of educational access that continue to severely impact Somali girls. “We must proactively create an environment where every girl has a fair chance to learn, grow and achieve her dreams free from discrimination and harm,” he emphasized. In his remarks at the occasion, UNFPA Somalia Representative Niyi Ojuolape called for increased multi-sectoral collaboration and investment to break long-standing cycles of gender inequality. Reiterating the community-wide and positive national impact of empowering the girl child, Ojuolape stated that “an empowered girl lifts her entire community, but can only do so by having access to health services, education and related opportunities. It is not only the morally right thing to do but also a pragmatic economic decision that aids national development,” he added. The event also marked the official launch of an innovative new project aimed at improving women and girls’ access to quality maternal and newborn healthcare across Somalia. The $2.7 million “Healthier Somali Women and Girls” project, funded by USAID and implemented by UNFPA, will strengthen maternal and child health services in marginalized communities of Southern and Central regions of Somalia. “With targeted investments and interventions, we can make a real difference in the lives of Somali women, newborns and infants.”emphasized USAID Mission Director Sheri-Nouane Duncan-Jones in her remarks. Further, UNICEF Somalia Representative Wafaa Abdelatef, in her statement at the event, noted that “We cannot make progress without listening directly to girls themselves, to understand their lived realities, hopes and ideas for positive change,” while urging for a more participatory approach in addressing the well-being of women and girls. A highlight of the event was an inter-generational panel discussion between young women and activists, government officials, UN representatives and civil society members focused on strategies to expand girls’ rights and opportunities in Somalia. Youth advocates shared personal stories of helping prevent child marriage and female genital mutilation in their communities, highlighting the importance of support networks. Broadly, the panelists spoke on the need for effective mentorships to end harmful practices and veritable platforms that allow young people to lend their voices to the advocacy. With rousing cultural performances, and urgent calls to action, the event succeeded in spotlighting the need to dramatically scale up targeted investments in the health, education, protection, and empowerment of Somali girls to unlock their enormous potential and catalyze national progress.",9367,october mogadishu somalia official country office united nations population fund unfpa united nations children fund unicef federal government somalia united states agency international development usaid join effort today commemorate international day girl child event design amplify right potential somali girl emphasize importance need empower high level event convene participant mogadishu include government leader un representative youth activist civil society group community elder journalist development partner opening remark deputy minister abdihakim jimale aden reiterate government strong commitment tackle persistent human right issue like child marriage female genital mutilation fgm lack educational access continue severely impact somali girl proactively create environment girl fair chance learn grow achieve dream free discrimination harm emphasize remark occasion unfpa somalia representative niyi ojuolape call increase multi sectoral collaboration investment break long stand cycle gender inequality reiterate community wide positive national impact empower girl child ojuolape state empowered girl lift entire community have access health service education related opportunity morally right thing pragmatic economic decision aid national development add event mark official launch innovative new project aim improve woman girl access quality maternal newborn healthcare somalia million healthier somali women girl project fund usaid implement unfpa strengthen maternal child health service marginalize community southern central region somalia target investment intervention real difference life somali woman newborn infant usaid mission director sheri nouane duncan jones remark unicef somalia representative wafaa abdelatef statement event note progress listen directly girl understand live reality hope idea positive change urge participatory approach address woman girl highlight event inter generational panel discussion young woman activist government official un representative civil society member focus strategy expand girl right opportunity somalia youth advocate share personal story helping prevent child marriage female genital mutilation community highlight importance support network broadly panelist speak need effective mentorship end harmful practice veritable platform allow young people lend voice advocacy rouse cultural performance urgent call action event succeed spotlight need dramatically scale target investment health education protection empowerment somali girl unlock enormous potential catalyze national progress
423365695,"Attachments On Tuesday, October 10, 2023, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held its first public hearing session on the case on the Application of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , brought by Canada and the Netherlands as State Parties to the Convention, against the Syrian regime (formally named the Canada and the Netherlands v. Syrian Arab Republic). At the request of the two countries, the session focused on imposing what are known as provisional measures on the Syrian regime to compel it to immediately cease torture against potential victims, while the trial of the Syrian regime for the alleged violation of the Convention Against Torture proceeds. According to the court session’s transcript , the case draws upon a number of UN sources, as well as on data provided by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), which was cited as a source 14 times, while the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (COI) was cited 24 times. In her oral argument, Annemarieke Künzli, Legal Counsel to the Kingdom of the Netherlands’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs, indicated that the Netherlands and Canada have made joint efforts to move forward with good-faith attempts at negotiations with the Syrian regime, which are well-documented through the exchange of 66 Notes Verbales over the course of three years, as well as through two in-person meetings held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in April and October 2022. All of these efforts have been fruitless, however, Ms. Künzli lamented. On the imperative need to impose provisional measures, Teresa Crockett, the Canada’s Deputy Director of the Accountability, Human Rights, and United Nations Law Division of Global Affairs Canada, stressed that there is no doubt that the Syrian regime’s continued and repeated violations of the Convention Against Torture “are causing irreparable prejudice to the rights at issue”. Such conditions, she underlined, require urgent intervention from the ICJ. Furthermore, Ms. Crockett pointed out that during the three-month delay period granted to the Syrian regime at its request, SNHR has documented no fewer than 15 cases of death due to torture at the hands of the Syrian regime. She also referenced SNHR’s extensive report which addresses the charges that were met with the capital punishment: “[Those accusations have] been leveled in a widespread and indiscriminate manner by the regime’s security agencies against thousands of detainees and forcibly disappeared persons . . . with no grounds except for interrogation records containing ‘confessions’ extracted under the duress of torture.” Relatedly, Ms. Crockett noted that SNHR has collected details of the Syrian regime’s “public prosecution’s reliance on confessions extracted under torture, and has confirmation of dozens of detainees having been forced to appear in grotesque ‘confession videos’, which are also broadcast on official State media.” At the conclusion of the argument, Alan H. Kessel, the Assistant Deputy Minster and Legal Advisor to Global Affairs Canada, outlined the objectives of the seven provisional measures requested, adding an eighth one which was that the “Court require Syria to take several immediate steps to reduce the risk of torture being committed by its officials and others within the system of detention.” He clarified that this includes “issuing instructions to all those involved in the detention system, [and at] checkpoints and hospitals to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with their inherent human dignity. They should also receive information and training on the prohibition against torture in accordance with Syria’s obligation under Article 10 of the Convention against Torture.” As it stands, the eight provisional measures as they appear in the court documents ad verbatim are: 1. Syria shall immediately take effective measures to cease and prevent all acts that amount to or contribute to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 2. In light of the greatly enhanced risk for detainees of being subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Syria shall immediately: cease arbitrary detention, and release all persons who are arbitrarily or unlawfully detained; cease all forms of incommunicado detention; allow access to all of its official and unofficial places of detention by independent monitoring mechanisms and medical personnel, and allow contact and visitations between detainees and their families and legal counsel; and; take urgent measures to improve the conditions of all of its official and unofficial detention facilities to ensure all detainees are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person in accordance with international standards; 3. Syria shall not destroy or render inaccessible any evidence related to the Application, including, without limitation, by destroying or rendering inaccessible medical or other records of injuries sustained as a result of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or the remains of any person who was a victim of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 4. Syria shall safeguard any information concerning the cause of death of any detainee who died while in detention or while hospitalised, including forensic examination of the human remains and places of burial, as well as afford the next of kin of any person who died as a result of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, following arrest, hospitalisation or detention with a death certificate, stating the true cause of death; 5. Syria shall disclose the location of the burial sites of persons who died as a result of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment following arrest, hospitalisation or detention, to the next of kin; 6. Syria shall not take any action, and shall ensure that no action is taken, which may aggravate or extend the existing dispute that is the subject of the Application, or render it more difficult to resolve; 7. Syria shall provide a report to the Court on all measures taken to give effect to its Order for provisional measures, beginning no later than six months from its issuance and every six months thereafter pending the resolution of the dispute; and. 8. Syria shall take immediate actions to reduce the risk of torture being committed by its officials and other personnel, including by issuing instructions to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with their human dignity, suspending all personnel suspected of having committed torture or other ill-treatment pending investigation, lifting de facto immunity for those of its officials who commit torture, and ensuring that statements obtained under torture are not used as evidence in any proceedings. In closing, Mr. Kessel stressed that “Justice and accountability are crucial to breaking the cycle of violence and atrocities, and are important as a step towards building a sustainable peace in Syria.” He added that the detainees currently held in regime detention centers are under the threat of imminent death or severe physical and mental harm, which would also apply to anyone who might be detained in the future. “Over a decade of inaction has shown that Syria cannot be relied on to refrain, on its own volition and without a binding order from the Court, from inflicting heinous acts of torture and other ill-treatment against its population,” he added. Moreover, he underscored that thousands of individuals in Syria are still detained, which emphasizes the need to take urgent action to prevent more unnecessary deaths and suffering. Finally, he underlined that the provisional measures requested by the prosecution are “practical, realistic and consistent with the protections offered by the Court in its previous orders indicating provisional measures,” stressing that such provisions “are necessarily comprehensive in order to preserve the rights at issue in the case, which are quite literally a matter of life and death.” On its part, the Court expressed its regrets over the non-appearance of the Syrian regime in the oral proceedings. At the session’s conclusion, the Court revealed that it will render its Order in a public sitting. Following the session, Canada and The Netherlands issued a , in which they stressed that “they are guided by the strong conviction that there can be no sustainable peace and lasting reconciliation in Syria without justice for victims and survivors.” Reiterating their commitment to upholding international law, they also called on all states and the international community to support accountability efforts for Syrians. The statement also lamented the Syrian regime’s choice not to appear “in these important proceedings, particularly in light of the three-month postponement granted to facilitate its participation.” On October 10, 2023, SNHR released a report entitled, ‘The Syrian Regime is Accused of Killing 15,051 Individuals, Including 190 Children and 94 Women, Under Torture in Its Detention Centers Since March 2011, While Nearly 136,000 Remain Forcibly Disappeared’ , in which the group hailed the case brought by Canada and The Netherlands against the Syrian regime before the ICJ as a serious step on the path of accountability. As SNHR’s database attests, no fewer than 135,638 individuals, including 3,693 children and 8,478 women (adult female), of those arrested since March 2011 up until August 2023 are still under arrest. Of these, 96,103 individuals, including 2,327 children and 5,739 women (adult female) are classified as forcibly disappeared persons, with all of them being subjected to one or multiple forms of torture. SNHR has also documented 83 methods of torture used by the Syrian regime in its detention centers. Despite having ratified the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2004, the Syrian regime has failed to uphold its obligations under the Convention. On the contrary, the regime has practiced torture in the most monstrous and worst possible ways, as shown by the data included in this report, both at the level of execution and through passing local laws that only nominally criminalize torture in a limited, wholly superficial way, while affording impunity to those involved in perpetrating torture. Furthermore, the Syrian regime practices torture in a systematic and widespread manner, violating the right to life, which constitutes a blatant breach of international human rights law. It has been repeatedly proven that the Syrian regime leadership has full knowledge of these practices, and is fully aware that these inhumane detention conditions lead inevitably to detainees’ deaths. The Syrian regime has deliberately allowed for, and carried out such practices through a decision made by a hierarchy that begins from the President of the Republic; answering directly to him are the ministers of defense and interior and the National Security Bureau, and their affiliated security apparatuses. We, at SNHR, believe in the importance of this trial as a serious step on the path of long overdue accountability, after the Syrian regime has been given absolute impunity for 13 years. We hope the court will impose the harshest possible provisional measures against the Syrian regime, which is known for destroying evidence and for its refusal to cooperate with UN bodies, or international and local human rights organizations.",9367,attachment tuesday october international court justice icj hold public hearing session case application convention torture cruel inhuman

We have seen in the local hospital a lot of women who require medical treatment, including maternal care and psychosocial support. UNFPA is here to ensure that they will receive appropriate services, especially for safe births,” said Jaime Nadal Roig, UNFPA’s representative in Afghanistan. Women and girls disproportionately affected. Most of those who died were women and children because they were in their houses while men were out to work. Displaced people are sheltering in abandoned buildings, makeshift shelters and tents, with some areas seeing every single home flattened by the disaster. Women-headed households are particularly vulnerable, with protection needs as well as challenges seeking and obtaining humanitarian assistance. Health teams and supplies deployed. Of the affected population, it is estimated that 3,028 are women of reproductive age, 1,414 are adolescent girls 10 to 19 years old, and 183 are likely to be currently pregnant and in need of midwifery care. UNFPA has deployed seven mobile health teams to quake-affected areas in Jibhrail, Zindajan and Shindani districts. Staff have also been deployed to the Herat Provincial Hospital, where survivors are being treated, and counsellors have arrived to provide psychosocial support services in temporary shelters. Dignity kits, containing hygiene supplies such as soap, underwear and menstrual pads, are also being distributed, with further distribution of blankets, tarpaulin, and supplies for safe childbirth and for postpartum mothers and newborns also planned. “We need hygiene kits, clothes and footwear because we lost everything when our homes were reduced into rubble,” said one woman, sheltering at a medical school within the Herat Provincial Hospital grounds.",9367,woman child shelter outside herat provincial hospital await care aftermath quake unfpa afghanistan arlene alano herat afghanistan people impact magnitude earthquake strike morning october severely injure believe unfpa local authority humanitarian actor rush humanitarian supply affected area continue experience aftershock unfpa ground provide life save assistance survivor devastating earthquake see local hospital lot woman require medical treatment include maternal care psychosocial support unfpa ensure receive appropriate service especially safe birth say jaime nadal roig unfpa representative afghanistan woman girl disproportionately affect die woman child house man work displaced people shelter abandon building makeshift shelter tent area see single home flatten disaster woman head household particularly vulnerable protection need challenge seek obtain humanitarian assistance health team supply deploy affected population estimate woman reproductive age adolescent girl year old likely currently pregnant need midwifery care unfpa deploy seven mobile health team quake affect area jibhrail zindajan shindani district staff deploy herat provincial hospital survivor treat counsellor arrive provide psychosocial support service temporary shelter dignity kit contain hygiene supply soap underwear menstrual pad distribute distribution blanket tarpaulin supply safe childbirth postpartum mother newborn plan need hygiene kit clothe footwear lose home reduce rubble say woman shelter medical school herat provincial hospital ground
423341887,"11 October 2023 The climate crisis is the greatest health challenge of the 21st century. The mean temperature is increasing rapidly and other climatic variables are worsening and these changes are occurring twice as fast in the Eastern Mediterranean Region as elsewhere in the world. The health impacts of climate change are substantial and include more deadly extreme weather events, increasing cases of noncommunicable diseases and the increased emergence and spread of infectious diseases. These impacts are already affecting the Region’s health workforce and infrastructure, reducing the capacity to achieve universal health coverage. Deep, rapid and sustained climate mitigation efforts and faster implementation of climate adaptation actions would reduce the projected damages and losses for humans and ecosystems. Further delays in acting on climate change will increase the risks and undermine decades of public health gains. Failing to act now will also contravene our collective commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals and the human right to health for all. As we speed towards 2030, WHO proposes a new regional framework for action to build climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems; to prioritize health in climate change policies; to engage the health sector effectively to support climate action by other sectors; to improve the health sector’s access to climate change funding; and to build a robust evidence base for policy-making. The framework is proposed for the period 20232029. Achieving these targets will require multisectoral transformative action across society. This includes: working within formal health systems; collaborating with health-determining sectors, such as energy, food, agriculture, water, transport, social affairs, security and finance; and; engaging with the general public to make a critical contribution to combating and adapting to climate change and accelerating progress towards health for all. Thirteen countries of the Region need to accelerate action through the Alliance on Transformative Action on Climate and Health. The remaining countries and territories of the Region are urged to join this WHO-led initiative. A technical report on climate change, which introduces the proposed framework for action, will be discussed at the 70th session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean. The report’s aim is to support every country and territory of the Region to commit to the Alliance and to accelerate action on climate change.",9367,october climate crisis great health challenge century mean temperature increase rapidly climatic variable worsen change occur twice fast eastern mediterranean region world health impact climate change substantial include deadly extreme weather event increase case noncommunicable disease increase emergence spread infectious disease impact affect region health workforce infrastructure reduce capacity achieve universal health coverage deep rapid sustained climate mitigation effort fast implementation climate adaptation action reduce project damage loss human ecosystem delay act climate change increase risk undermine decade public health gain fail act contravene collective commitment sustainable development goals human right health speed propose new regional framework action build climate resilient environmentally sustainable health system prioritize health climate change policy engage health sector effectively support climate action sector improve health sector access climate change funding build robust evidence base policy making framework propose period achieve target require multisectoral transformative action society include work formal health system collaborate health determine sector energy food agriculture water transport social affair security finance engage general public critical contribution combat adapt climate change accelerate progress health thirteen country region need accelerate action alliance transformative action climate health remain country territory region urge join lead initiative technical report climate change introduce propose framework action discuss session regional committee eastern mediterranean report aim support country territory region commit alliance accelerate action climate change

After multiple aftershocks and a second earthquake of the same magnitude early on 11 October, the UN and the authorities are reporting between 1,000 and 3,000 deaths. These numbers are expected to rise in the next hours and days. In the village at the epicentre of the first earthquake, every single building has been flattened. Across the province, many families are sleeping out in the streets. Several hundred are reported missing, according to the UN. Those affected by the disaster are still searching for relatives amidst the rubble and are seeking out assistance from aid agencies and authorities. According to the latest UN OCHA report, an estimated 12,110 people have been affected by the earthquake across five districts in Herat province. Yet another shock for an already fragile Afghanistan. The humanitarian aid system in Afghanistan is already desperately overstretched and underfunded, with over 29 million Afghans already in need of humanitarian assistance. The country’s food rations from the World Food Programme have also recently been reduced substantially due to funding cuts, leaving millions of families without enough to eat. As winter approaches, there are concerns about how affected communities are going to survive. The road to recovery for Afghans will be long and difficult. We are on the ground ready to respond. On the ground, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) emergency teams are coordinating between affected communities, Afghan authorities and other NGOs to help those impacted as quickly as possible. Our response will be split between addressing immediate needs such as emergency shelter, blankets and site coordination, and more long-term planning to support affected communities to recover post emergency.

423286480,"Gates Foundation Celebrates 20 Years of “Grand Challenges” With New Investments and a Call to Make R&D Breakthroughs Available More Quickly and Equitably    Commitments focus on advancing equitable access to artificial intelligence (AI) and vaccines, and catalyzing innovations that address women’s health. DAKAR and SEATTLE (October 10, 2023) A slate of new initiatives to support locally led innovation was announced today in Dakar by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its partners at the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting. The investments come with an urgent call for countries to step up funding to make the research and development (R&D) of health and development innovations easier and faster, and to make the next generation of scientific and technological breakthroughs relevant and accessible to all. Data shows that while overall health R&D funding is increasing, only about 2% is directed toward diseases that affect the world’s poorest people. In 2020, the annual funding gap for product development targeting poverty-related and neglected diseases was estimated at US$2.6 billion. “Over the past two decades, global investments in a pipeline of innovative solutions helped reduce childhood deaths under 5 by half,” said Moussa Balde, Senegal’s minister for higher education, research and innovation. “But lifesaving innovations still take too long to reach those who need them and are not always designed with equity from the start. Grand Challenges Senegal continues to invest in the country's brightest scientists and innovators, and we are pleased to be part of this global network of Grand Challenges partners investing in locally led solutions to ensure innovations, including in health, education, and agriculture, benefit everyone equally.” Launched in 2003, Grand Challenges, the foundation’s flagship innovation program, focuses attention and funding on pressing global health and development problems that affect the world’s poorest people, using open calls for proposals to crowdsource potential solutions. In an address to the more than 1,400 scientists, policymakers, and donors attending the annual meeting, Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, called for the world to spend at least US$3 billion more every year on global health and development R&D in order to close the critical gaps in funding for neglected diseases. “New health technologies have the potential to save millions of lives, but R&D funding is going in the wrong direction,” said Gates. “Donors need to step up their commitments to ensure health innovations reach those who need them more quickly, so more lives can be saved.' Today, Gates announced that the foundation is investing US$30 million to support a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform in Africa. The platform will provide African scientists and innovators with the technical and operational support they need to turn promising ideas into scalable health and development solutions. It is a step towards ensuring the benefits of AI are relevant, affordable, and accessible to everyoneparticularly those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)and that these critical tools are developed safely, ethically, and equitably. The foundation will continue to work closely with technical partners and governments to further advance the platform and identify opportunities to jointly advance Yesterday, the foundation also announced new investments aimed at expanding access to a novel mRNA vaccine manufacturing platform that gives countries, including Senegal and South Africa, the technology to develop and manufacture their own vaccines. mRNA technology is considered a potential game-changer for a range of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, and Lassa fever, which disproportionately affect people in LMICs. This additional local vaccine manufacturing capacity will support LMICs to develop low-cost, high-quality vaccines that address their most urgent health priorities. “What started as a single program funded by the Gates Foundation and its partners has grown into a family of initiatives and partnerships across national borders, fields of study, and sectors that catalyze research, products, and partnerships to save and improve the lives of the world’s most vulnerable people,” said Kedest Tesfagiorgis, deputy director, Global Partnerships and Grand Challenges at the foundation. “Our community of brilliant innovators is proof that a great idea can come from anywhere and be supported by the funders, policymakers, and advocates needed to move ideas into the laboratory and, ultimately, to the people who can most benefit from them.” Grand Challenges is supported by the governments of China, India, Brazil, the United States, and Canada, as well as a growing number of countries in Africa, including Ethiopia, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa. Since 2003, partners have invested US$1.6 billion to support more than 3,800 projects in 118 countriesfrom new strategies to improve gut health in moms and children to reinventing the toilet for improved sanitation to reimagining drug discovery research for malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases. To further support scientists developing cutting-edge innovations in LMICs, the foundation and its partners also issued new calls for proposals in the following areas: Equitable AI for health in LMICs. Building on a to develop global health and development solutions in LMICs using AI-enabled large language models (LLMs), GC partners issued a request for proposals of up to US$5.5 million to help advance the development of robust, locally relevant, AI-empowered tools to expedite decision-making, policy pathways, and implementation by frontline health workers and policymakers. The call is led by GC Brazil, GC India, GC Ethiopia, GC Senegal, GC South Africa, and GC Africa, with support from GC Canada, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, the Pasteur Network, and the Gates Foundation. Women’s health R&D to unlock the potential of half the world’s population and unleash a powerful engine for progress. The is a new report outlining 50 equitable, high-return opportunities across the R&D continuum to maximize research and innovation, investments, and global action in women’s health. To encourage innovations and ideas laid out in the Opportunity Map, the foundation announced a new request for proposals that will provide up to US$3.6 million in funding.

423286736,"ADDIS ABABA, 11 October 2023 On International Day of the Girl, Save the Children has released a series of double exposure portraits by Maheder Haileselassie Tadese, winner of the 2023 Contemporary African Photography Prize, showing the devastating impact of severe drought on girls’ lives in Ethiopia. Five failed rainy seasons across the Horn of Africa have left up to 20 million people in Ethiopia food insecure. Girls in parts of the country hit by drought and food shortages are increasingly being forced into child marriage, with rates rising by 119% in 2022.[1] Maheder Haileselassie Tadese spent time with girls in the Somali region, capturing their experiences on the front line of climate change. Bone-dry water sources, decimated crops and dying livestock had combined with vicious conflict to make early marriage a threat to all of them. Maheder said:* “It struck me that the girls’ experience of child marriage story was linked to the changing climate. Recurrent drought in the Somali region means that the earth no longer provides families and their livestock with the water and nutritious food that they need. This is why I made the drought-affected landscape and dried river an integral part of each portrait, to represent how child marriage and climate change intertwine.”* The award-winning photographer's double exposure approach captures portraitsof the girls alongside photographs representing their memories, hopes and fears. The creative images also feature the resources pastoralist families depend on for survival amid the arid landscapes that have wiped them out. Together these layers represent the factors pushing families towards child marriage along with the strength of the girls and their communities to resist. Girls who marry young face harsh and far-reaching consequences. They are far less likely to stay in school, with lifelong economic impacts. Child brides are also at greater risk of experiencing dangerous complications in pregnancy and childbirth. They are often isolated, and at higher risk of lifelong physical and sexual violence. A new report released yesterday by Save the Children “ Girls at the centre of the storm: Her planet, her future, her solutions *” *reveals that the number of girls living in high risk ‘hotspots’ for child marriage and climate change is set to increase by one third, to nearly 40 million by 2050. [2] Asma*, was aged 14 when a man expressed his interest in marrying her. As pastoralists impacted by droughts, her parents felt that marrying early could offer her a better quality of life. Supported by Save the Children, Asma* was able to avoid the marriage and now campaigns against early marriage in her community. “*The drought affects my family because our animals are our only income. * Before the drought we had milk and meat, but when drought comes there is no milk, there is no meat. And there is a serious problem with scarcity of water and our livestock have no water to drink. “When I was 14 years old, a man wanted to marry me and my parents agreed. I became unhappy and withdrawn at school, I was depressed.**Because he was a wealthier person than us, my parents advised me that if I got married to him my life would become better than theirs. Aida*, 20, was married aged 15 after being displaced due to conflict and drought. She was devastated at the time and had to leave school. After a few months in this forced marriage, she became depressed and with the support of her uncle, she fled to the nearby city to escape before returning to live with her family when it was safe. “Since being displaced, life has been difficult. We used to plough in our fields. We grew and ate whatever we wanted from our garden. Now we have nothing to eat, we are suffering a lot, we live in a shack house and the heat is terrible. We are just living here in the hope that it will pass. “I was married at the age of 15. My parents married me off thinking our problems would become easier. They gave me to this man to alleviate our troubles. I told them that I would rather die than living with this man.” Lelo*, 15, avoided early marriage at 14. Her parents agreed to the marriage because their family were struggling economically due to losing their livestock during the drought. “The land was fertile and green. The animals were healthy and fat. The land was once fertile, but the following year, there was a severe drought. The animals died. Even the plants dried up. I swear the weather changed. Heat, wind, and storms came. When I was 14, I was proposed to. The man proposed to my family, and I was informed when I arrived [home]. I was demoralized.” Data analysis published in *Girls at the centre of the storm *shows that the situation is likely to get worse estimating that between now and 2030, almost 60% of girls, some 931 million, will experience at least one extreme weather event, like flooding, drought or heatwaves. Maheder Haileselassie Tadese ** winner of the 2023 Contemporary African Photography Prize, said:** *“I met girls who had been married when they were just 14, forced to leave school because their families were desperate for economic support. For Aida*’s portrait I used images of sorghum and maize, because she described happy memories of her family growing crops and fresh fruits before she was displaced and forced to marry aged 14. When one looks closely, the tree * branches on Saeda*’s face look almost like a vein, a metaphor to what trees, land and a good climate means to her and her community. Camels are for her memory of the camels her family lost during the drought. “But I also wanted to capture the strength and power of the girls campaigning against child marriage. Their determination to help more girls stay in education and fulfil their dreams was important.” Xavier Joubert, Country Director for ** Save the Children Ethiopia says:** “*These powerful photographs illustrate just how vulnerable girls are to extreme weather events like drought. Drought ruins livelihoods, increasing food shortages and poverty. Many girls face the consequences of either having to leave school or marry far too young. No child should lose their childhood to the effects of climate change. * “It’s vital we promote gender equality, put girls at the heart of our climate action efforts and take steps to reduce gender-based violence and child marriage. Governments must increase support to girls and other children most at risk, and above all, accelerate their efforts to end child marriage and stop this abuse of girls’ rights.” Save the Children has been operating inEthiopiafor over 60 years with its work focused on health and nutrition as well as life-saving water and sanitation assistance, protection services, education support, and cash and in-kind distributions. In 2022, Save the Children reached about 7.6 million people including 5.1 million children. NOTES TO EDITORS: References: [[1]] UNICEF.

423326255,"This week, we spoke to Nicole Ntagabo, MAG’s Regional Director for the Sahel and West Africa. First off, can you summarise our activities in the Sahel and West Africa? MAG has been present in the region for more than 10 years, working to prevent and reduce the harmful impact of conflicts on populations. In that sense, MAG has been supporting Small Arms & Light Weapons (SALW) control and Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) efforts, collaborating with national and regional authorities as well as various expert organisations and institutions. Today, MAG’s Armed Violence Reduction (AVR) work focuses on three main areas: reducing the impact of armed violence on communities through risk reduction strategies; mitigating the risks of unplanned explosions at munition sites, as well as the risk posed by the illicit diversion of weapons; and supporting states and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in their national SALW control objectives, strategies, and compliance with instruments. In addition, MAG’s HMA work focuses on developing national mine action centres and institutional capacities to respond more effectively to legacy and new contaminations. It also reduces risks of accidents and the impact of explosive ordnance through risk education, non-technical survey, and clearance where possible; and supports states to fulfil their international obligations in line with the Antipersonnel Mine Ban Convention (APMBC) and the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM). What are the main drivers of instability and violence in the region that MAG aims to counter/respond to? A complex web of drivers of instability and violence contribute to the region's challenges. A lot of these drivers are interconnected, making it very important for MAG to understand the contexts in which our work is taking place. The consolidation of non-state armed groups in the Sahel since the beginning of the war in Libya in 2011 has destabilized already fragile institutions, contributing to political instability. Climate change, desertification, and droughts have disrupted livelihoods, particularly in rural areas heavily dependent on agriculture and pastoralism. Competition over scarce land and resources, as well as political power, often result in communal tensions, which have fuelled conflicts within countries. Non-state armed groups often exploit these grievances, and weak governance, to recruit and expand their influence in new places where central states have difficulties to provide essential services and maintain security. This has resulted in a spill over of violence from country to country. The instability, and the associated spread of violence, has largely been fuelled by the proliferation of SALW in the region. Weapons often flow across porous borders, contributing to the intensity and duration of conflicts. SALW trafficking in West Africa is fed by easy access to stockpiles of arms and facilitated by weak responses from regional state security providers who often lack resources, capacity, or political support. In addition, the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) has also become one of the most common modus operandi of non-state armed groups in the region and while it appears that the intended targets are the defence and security forces, more and more civilians are indiscriminately killed and maimed. Can you give an example of a particularly successful initiative that MAG has recently conducted? MAG has been developing its partnership approach, working hand in hand with a diverse range of local civil society actors who possess deep insights into the communities they serve. Their presence and credibility enhance the acceptance and impact of all our initiatives, especially risk education activities. They often establish networks that facilitate access to vulnerable populations, ensuring that life-saving information reaches those who need it most. We are really pleased to witness the growth and development of our local partners, becoming stronger, more influential, and increasingly professional and technical in their capacities. It not only reflects the efficacy of our partnership but also holds significant implications for our broader mission. **What impact does MAG’s work have on local people and communities? ** The impact of ongoing and past conflicts in the Sahel and West Africa is multifaceted, with significant humanitarian, social, and economic consequences. MAG works diligently to reach the largest possible number of people with life-saving information on contamination. This is particularly critical for children and returning communities as it enables safer humanitarian access and development in the future. Our efforts with SALW and ammunition also prevent and reduce the risks of accidents, allowing individuals and communities to feel secure in their living environments. What are the main challenges of MAG’s work in Sahel and West Africa? The region is unfortunately becoming increasingly complex due to deteriorating security conditions and political instability. Populations are particularly affected in border areas where the presence of states and the services they offer are limited, which creates a vacuum that non-state armed groups exploit by recruiting young people who lack economic opportunities, which perpetuates cycles of violence. Humanitarian organisations like MAG face difficulties in reaching the communities in need in environments that are increasingly volatile. Being conflict-sensitive and balancing humanitarian principles with our work and access to population is therefore critical for MAG. Finally, mobilizing resources in the region is challenging, especially in the current global context, where MAG and other organisations are operating in a very resource-constrained setting, and where needs continue to be on the rise. What does the next five years look like for MAG in Sahel and West Africa? MAG's work remains incredibly relevant and important in the face of the serious security and humanitarian challenges in the region. Our strategy centres on working closely with trusted partners at various levels to develop sustainable capacities that can effectively tackle the region's diverse challenges, which vary from one country to another. We'll assist states that lack the capacity to deal with new contamination, helping them establish the necessary capabilities to fulfil their obligations under the APMBC, especially as conflict situations evolve. We recognise that our skilled workforce is at the heart of our success. So, we're dedicated to investing in our staff, ensuring they have the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complex challenges in the Sahel and West Africa effectively.",9367,week speak nicole ntagabo mag regional director sahel west africa summarise activity sahel west africa mag present region year work prevent reduce harmful impact conflict population sense mag support small arms light weapons salw control humanitarian action hma effort collaborate national regional authority expert organisation institution today mag armed violence reduction avr work focus main area reduce impact armed violence community risk reduction strategy mitigate risk unplanned explosion munition site risk pose illicit diversion weapon support state economic community west african states ecowas national salw control objective strategy compliance instrument addition mag hma work focus develop national action centre institutional capacity respond effectively legacy new contamination reduce risk accident impact explosive ordnance risk education non technical survey clearance possible support state fulfil international obligation line antipersonnel ban convention apmbc convention cluster munitions ccm main driver instability violence region mag aim counter respond complex web driver instability violence contribute region challenge lot driver interconnect make important mag understand context work take place consolidation non state armed group sahel beginning war libya destabilize fragile institution contribute political instability climate change desertification drought disrupt livelihood particularly rural area heavily dependent agriculture pastoralism competition scarce land resource political power result communal tension fuel conflict country non state armed group exploit grievance weak governance recruit expand influence new place central state difficulty provide essential service maintain security result spill violence country country instability associate spread violence largely fuel proliferation salw region weapon flow porous border contribute intensity duration conflict salw traffic west africa feed easy access stockpile arm facilitate weak response regional state security provider lack resource capacity political support addition use improvise explosive device ied common modu operandi non state armed group region appear intend target defence security force civilian indiscriminately kill maim example particularly successful initiative mag recently conduct mag develop partnership approach work hand hand diverse range local civil society actor possess deep insight community serve presence credibility enhance acceptance impact initiative especially risk education activity establish network facilitate access vulnerable population ensure life save information reach need pleased witness growth development local partner strong influential increasingly professional technical capacity reflect efficacy partnership hold significant implication broad mission impact mag work local people community impact ongoing past conflict sahel west africa multifacete significant humanitarian social economic consequence mag work diligently reach large possible number people life save information contamination particularly critical child return community enable safe humanitarian access development future effort salw ammunition prevent reduce risk accident allow individual community feel secure live environment main challenge mag work sahel west africa region unfortunately increasingly complex deteriorate security condition political instability population particularly affect border area presence state service offer limit create vacuum non state armed group exploit recruit young people lack economic opportunity perpetuate cycle violence humanitarian organisation like mag face difficulty reach community need environment increasingly volatile conflict sensitive balance humanitarian principle work access population critical mag finally mobilize resource region challenge especially current global context mag organisation operate resource constrain setting need continue rise year look like mag sahel west africa mag work remain incredibly relevant important face security humanitarian challenge region strategy centre work closely trust partner level develop sustainable capacity effectively tackle region diverse challenge vary country assist state lack capacity deal new contamination help establish necessary capability fulfil obligation apmbc especially conflict situation evolve recognise skilled workforce heart success dedicated invest staff ensure knowledge skill need navigate complex challenge sahel west africa effectively

423310759,"In Numbers. 8,553 MT of food commodities distributed. USD 6.3 million cash-based transfers made. USD 73.8 million net funding requirements across all activities for the next six months (September-February 2023) 1.76 million people assisted in July 2023. Food Security Situation The 2023 Long Rains Food and Nutrition Security Assessment carried out in 23 arid and semi-arid counties revealed a significant reduction in acute food insecurity levels. The assessment indicated that 2.8 million Kenyans are acutely food insecure, down from 4.4 million in February 2023. Out of this, 2.3 million individuals are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), while 0.5 million are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The primary drivers of food and nutrition insecurity include poor rainfall distribution, the cumulative impact of previous poor rainfall seasons, elevated staple food prices, expensive agricultural inputs, and poor dietary intake among children, among others. The improved food security situation can be attributed to favourable rainfall during the March to May season, with further progress anticipated due to forecasted positive rainfall patterns in the upcoming October to December period, attributed to El-Nino conditions. Improvements in the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition were observed. This is attributed to expanded drought response efforts and the enhanced food security situation. Despite this positive trend, arid counties still experience elevated levels of acute malnutrition with extreme critical phases identified, in Turkana South sub-county. The number of acute malnutrition cases among children aged 6 to 59 months decreased to 947,000 in July 2023, from 970,000 in February, while 144,940 pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls (PBWGs) are currently affected by acute malnutrition.

423310418,"Area general updates Nearly 175,500 internally displaced people are sheltering in 88 UNRWA schools across the Gaza Strip. The numbers continue to increase as airstrikes continue from the Israeli Air Forces. UNRWA staff are working around the clock to respond to the needs of the displaced in the shelters. However, some are overcrowded and have limited availability of food, other basic items and potable water. UNRWA has over 5,300 UNRWA workers managing shelters. In coordination with the World Food Programme (WFP), bread was distributed to the displaced people in the shelters. Two UNRWA schools were affected by airstrikes, bringing the total number of installations affected by the conflict to 20 since 7 October. Turmoil in major Palestinian cities has been reported and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli Forces around checkpoints and settlements across the West Bank. The Israeli Authorities closed all crossings from the West Bank into East Jerusalem and Israel for Palestinian ID holders, including UN and International NGOs staff. Movements between governorates and cities within the West Bank remains challenging, as ad hoc closures and restrictions are put in place by Israeli Authorities., Closures of checkpoints around East Jerusalem were partially eased while flying checkpoints were set up at entrances of Palestinian neighborhoods in the city. All checkpoints isolating parts of the Israeli-controlled area of Hebron (H2) from the rest of the city were closed for the third consecutive day, impeding the movement of 7,000 Palestinian residents and restricting them from accessing basic services like health and education. essential services. Protection of Civilians According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 900 people were killed including 290 children. Another 4,250 were injured since 7 October in the Gaza Strip. Thirty (30) UNRWA students (17 girls and 13 boys) have been killed and another eight were injured (six boys and two girls). Nine UNRWA personnel (six staff and three contractors) were killed, while three teachers were injured. 16 internally displaced people sheltering at an UNRWA school were injured, including two critically, as a result of an airstrike nearby. In the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), 17 Palestinians were killed including four children. Of these, three were Palestine Refugees, including one child. Meanwhile, another 295 were reported injured (OCHA oPt). According to Israeli sources, 1,000 people were killed in Israel. Education All UNRWA schools across the Gaza Strip, including the Rehabilitation Centre for Visually Impaired and the two vocational centres in Gaza and Khan Younis remain closed. Some are being considered to become shelters as the number of internally displaced continues to increase. In the West Bank, most UNRWA schools have remained open, operating at limited capacity, through teachers and staff living close to schools. Some of the schools in hotspot locations, including Hebron H2, remained closed, and turned to remote learning. Health Only 11 (out of 22) UNRWA Health Centres across the Gaza Strip are able to provide primary healthcare services from 9:00 to 12:30 to patients with urgent referred appointments received through the free-toll hotline. 111 health staff (12 % of total health staff) are present at the health centres. Emergency health-care services through the toll-free hotline continue across all areas. With needs increasing on the ground and the conflict intensifying, UNRWA is looking into scaling up its capacity in the accessible health centers mobilizing more staff and opening for longer hours, whilst ensuring personnel security and safety. As of 14:00 hrs, 1,248 callers used the toll-free hotline and were provided with services. Medicines were delivered to the health centres from its central pharmacy. Pharmacy stocks are not affected by shortages for now. One UNRWA health centre in Jabalia (north of the Gaza Strip) is likely to run out of medicines in the next 14 days. Local community continues to appeal to UNRWA to open closed health centres due to high demand for health services. In the West Bank, most UNRWA health centres are open, also operating at limited capacity, due to movement and access restrictions. Sanitation Services All solid waste collection and transfer to landfill activities remain on hold. Transfer of solid waste from shelters to the landfills has started. Water wells in Jabalia, Khan Younis and Rafah are functional with about 9,000 cubic metres pumped from nine water wells. Provision of potable water through tankers continues to several designated emergency shelters in the Khan Younis area. Emergency repair of water network at Jabalia water well was carried out. 40 sanitation workers are working on the operation of all sanitation activities. In the West Bank, sanitation labourers removed garbage in the camps. Due to limited movement, challenges were reported with moving waste from the transfer stations in the camps to the landfills. Relief and Social Services Nearly half a million people (112,000 families) have not been able to get their food rations since UNRWA food distribution centres closed on 7 October; Helplines are operational and Psychological First Aid provided remotely. 33 social workers are available to provide psychosocial support remotely. General UNRWA operations; With an increased number of schools sheltering the internally displaced, additional mobile toilets and showers are being deployed. UNRWA distributed mattresses, mats, blankets and jerrycans in the designated emergency shelters. People with specific needs are prioritized as the quantity is insufficient to cover all needs. Maintenance work (with 31 staff) is carried out in 35 UNRWA emergency shelters. Staff movement remains restricted except for staff providing services. UNRWA Installations An UNRWA school in the Middle Area was affected by collateral damage due to an airstrike that hit a building adjacent to the school. Shrapnel was also found in the schoolyard.

423346894,"La Comisión Europea, el Banco Europeo de Inversiones y Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation han anunciado hoy un nuevo acuerdo de financiación para iniciativas sanitarias críticas a escala mundial. Se trata de erradicar la poliomielitis y de velar por que las innovaciones en materia de salud lleguen mejor a las personas que más las necesitan. La Organización Mundial de la Salud y UNICEF, como socios ejecutantes para la financiación destinada a la poliomielitis, invertirán los recursos para erradicar esa enfermedad, apoyar la distribución de otras inmunizaciones infantiles y reforzar los sistemas sanitarios para que puedan reaccionar mejor ante nuevas amenazas para la salud. La dotación prevista por valor de 1 100 millones de euros tiene por objeto facilitar nueva financiación para erradicar una enfermedad humana por segunda vez en la historia y contribuirá a resolver los problemas de salud y desarrollo que sufren las personas más vulnerables del mundo, que de otro modo no obtendrían un acceso justo a los servicios e innovaciones en materia de asistencia sanitaria. La presidenta de la Comisión Europea, Ursula von der Leyen, ha declarado: Estamos a punto de desterrar la poliomielitis de la faz de la Tierra. La Comisión Europea, el BEI y la Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation cooperan para recorrer el tramo final. Invertiremos 1 000 millones de euros con cargo a nuestra estrategia de inversión europea Global Gateway en sistemas sanitarios más sólidos a escala mundial y en la producción, la fabricación y la administración locales de vacunas y medicamentos, allí donde más se necesiten. La cooperación mundial nos ha ayudado a poner fin a la pandemia de COVID-19. Ahora nos ayudará a deshacernos de la poliomielitis de una vez por todas. El acuerdo supone un aumento considerable de la financiación destinada a la salud y el desarrollo humano a escala mundial, con cargo al Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Sostenible Plus (FEDS+) de la Comisión Europea, y se prevé que incluya nuevos fondos complementarios para la salud mundial aportados por Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, maximizando así el efecto de cada euro comprometido por la UE y el Banco Europeo de Inversiones. Werner Hoyer, presidente del Banco Europeo de Inversiones, ha afirmado: Hoy nos unimos para escribir el último capítulo de la historia de la poliomielitis. El Banco Europeo de Inversiones va a desempeñar su cometido en esta cooperación única con socios del mundo de la salud y de la filantropía al aportar 500 millones de euros para inversiones en apoyo del Programa Global de Erradicación de Polio. Esta iniciativa será un hito en la difusión de la inmunización y el refuerzo de la asistencia sanitaria, de manera que todos los niños, independientemente de sus circunstancias, puedan ser protegidos contra la poliomielitis. Para promover un rápido avance hacia la erradicación del poliovirus silvestre, la asociación tiene previsto aportar 500 millones de euros en pagos a la Iniciativa Mundial de Erradicación de la Poliomelitis, y concretamente a la Organización Mundial de la Salud y UNICEF. Con esos fondos se sufragará la vacunación contra la poliomielitis de casi 370 millones de niños al año; se prestarán servicios sanitarios vitales a los niños con ocasión de las campañas contra la poliomielitis, por ejemplo, vacunas contra el sarampión y otras inmunizaciones rutinarias; y se reforzarán los sistemas sanitarios para prepararse y responder mejor a nuevas amenazas para la salud, como ha hecho el programa de la poliomelitis contra la COVID-19, el ébola y otras enfermedades. En la actualidad, el poliovirus salvaje sigue siendo endémico en solo dos países (Pakistán y Afganistán) y el 80 % de los casos de poliovirus de la variante se localiza tan solo en cuatro de sus regiones. Bill Gates, copresidente de Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation*, ha dicho: Gracias a las innovaciones médicas, el mundo erradicó una enfermedad humana, la viruela. Hoy estamos a punto de acabar con otra, la provocada por el poliovirus salvaje. Me comprometo a garantizar que ningún niño, en ningún lugar del mundo, sufra esta terrible enfermedad. También confío en que erradicaremos la poliomielitis de una vez por todas y haremos que las innovaciones sanitarias sean más accesibles para todos, especialmente en los países más pobres*. Otros 500 millones de euros están previstos para ampliar la capacidad de innovación de los sistemas sanitarios en los países de renta baja y media. Esto abarca nuevos fondos para iniciativas respaldadas por la Comisión Europea, por ejemplo, esfuerzos por hacer que las innovaciones sanitarias como las vacunas y las terapias basadas en el ARN, sean más accesibles para los habitantes de países de renta baja y media, con cargo al plan europeo de inversiones mundiales, Global Gateway. Los dirigentes y socios mundiales estudiarán más inversiones en salud en todo el mundo en el próximo    (25 y 26 de octubre). Melinda French Gates, copresidenta de Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, ha hecho las observaciones siguientes: Gracias al liderazgo y la cooperación de la Comisión Europea y el Banco Europeo de Inversiones, las vacunas, los medicamentos y otras innovaciones que salvan vidas deberían llegar a las personas que más los necesitan, mejorando así la salud de las comunidades en todas partes. Sabemos que, cuando una comunidad es sana, la economía crece. El Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general de la OMS, ha comentado: Llegar a niños no vacunados o poco vacunados en las zonas más remotas y de difícil acceso es esencial para culminar la labor de erradicar la poliomielitis. Estos nuevos fondos no solo contribuirán a que avancemos hacia un mundo libre de poliomelitis, sino que también ayudarán a crear sistemas sanitarios más sostenibles y resilientes a fin de proteger a los mismos niños y comunidades expuestos al peligro de la poliomielitis frente a otras muchas amenazas para su salud. Catherine Russell, directora ejecutiva de UNICEF, ha afirmado: La erradicación de la poliomielitis está al alcance, pero los avances son frágiles y debemos seguir bien centrados. Esta nueva financiación contribuirá a garantizar que todos los niños sean vacunados para erradicar la poliomielitis, y reforzará a la vez los sistemas sanitarios comunitarios. Ningún niño debe padecer una enfermedad fácil de prevenir. En concreto, el acuerdo de financiación prevé lo siguiente: Nuevos fondos por valor de 500 millones de euros para la Iniciativa Mundial de Erradicación de Polio, tal como se ha indicado. 500 millones de euros en concepto de inversiones y subvenciones para garantizar que las innovaciones sanitarias sean más accesibles, refuercen los sistemas sanitarios y preparen para futuras pandemias: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation tiene previsto aportar 250 millones de euros en subvenciones e inversiones para igualar el importe de 250 millones de euros en inversiones realizadas por el Banco Europeo de Inversiones y garantizadas por el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Sostenible Plus. Subvenciones por valor de 80 millones de euros para asistencia técnica: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation prevé aportar 40 millones de euros para igualar las subvenciones concedidas por la Comisión Europea a fin de prestar asistencia técnica y velar por que los programas de salud mundiales aprovechen todo su potencial. El acuerdo anunciado hoy se basa en las asociaciones existentes entre Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation y la Comisión Europea y los Estados miembros, incluido un paquete de ayudas por valor de 100 millones de euros para la Agencia Africana de Medicamentos (AMA) recientemente creada y las agencias nacionales africanas de regulación de los medicamentos o iniciativas regionales, la Plataforma Africana de Diagnósticos Sanitarios, que ayuda a los socios africanos a mejorar el acceso a las pruebas de laboratorio y a reducir sus costes, y la coordinación de iniciativas sanitarias como COVAX , una colaboración a escala mundial para acelerar el desarrollo, la producción y el acceso equitativo a las pruebas, tratamientos y vacunas contra la COVID-19.

423346895,"Attachments Today, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a new financing partnership to address critical global health opportunities: eradicating polio and ensuring that innovations in health are more accessible to the people who need them most. The World Health Organization and UNICEF, as implementing partners for the polio funding, will deploy the resources to eradicate polio, support the distribution of other childhood immunizations and strengthen health systems so they are better able to respond to emerging health threats. The expected €1.1 billion financing package aims to provide new funding to eradicate a human disease for only the second time in history and help solve the health and development challenges faced by the world's most vulnerable people, who otherwise do not get fair access to healthcare services and innovations. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: 'We are about to wipe polio off the face of the Earth. The European Commission, the EIB and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are partnering to get through the final stretch. With 1 billion euros supported by our European investment strategy Global Gateway, we will invest in stronger health systems globally and local vaccine and medicines production, manufacturing and administration, where it is most needed. Global cooperation has helped us put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it will help us get rid of polio once and for all.' The partnership marks a significant increase in funding for global health and human development under the European Commission's European Fund for Sustainable Development plus (EFSD+) and is expected to include a match of new complementary funding for global health by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, maximising the impact of every Euro committed by the EU and the European Investment Bank. 'Today we are united to write the final chapter in the history of polio. The European Investment Bank is playing its part in a unique partnership with philanthropy and health partners, by providing EUR 500 million for investment in support of the Global Polio Eradication Programme. This initiative will be a milestone in scaling up immunization and strengthening healthcare, ensuring that every child, regardless of their circumstances, can be protected against polio,' said Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank. To promote swift progress towards eradicating wild poliovirus, the partnership aims to deliver €500 million in payments to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative -- specifically the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The funds will cover polio vaccinations for nearly 370 million children annually; deliver vital health services to children alongside polio campaigns, including measles vaccines and other routine immunizations; and strengthen health systems to better prepare and respond to emerging health threats, as the polio program has done against COVID-19, Ebola, and other diseases. Today, wild poliovirus remains endemic in just two countries -- Pakistan and Afghanistan -- and 80% of variant poliovirus cases are found in just four subnational regions. 'Thanks to medical innovations, the world eradicated one human disease -- smallpox. Today we're on the verge of ending another -- wild poliovirus. I am committed to ensuring that no child, anywhere in the world, faces this awful disease. I am also optimistic that we will eradicate polio once and for all and make health innovations more accessible for everyone, particularly those in the poorest countries,' said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Another €500 million aims to expand the innovation capacity of health systems in low- and middle-income countries. This includes new funding to initiatives supported by the European Commission such as efforts to make health innovations like mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics more accessible to people in low- and middle-income countries, under Europe's investment plan for the world, Global Gateway. More investments in health worldwide will be discussed among global leaders and partners at the upcoming (25-26 October) 'Thanks to the leadership and partnership of the European Commission and European Investment Bank, vaccines, medicines and other life-saving innovations should reach the people who need them most, making communities everywhere healthier. We know that when a community is healthy, economies grow,' said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 'Reaching un- or under-vaccinated children in the most remote and hardest-to-reach areas is essential for finishing the job of polio eradication,' said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. 'These new funds will not only help to drive us towards a polio-free world, but will also help to build more sustainable and resilient health systems to protect the same children and communities who are at risk of polio against the many other health threats they face.' 'Polio eradication is within reach, but the progress is fragile, and we must remain laser focused,' said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. 'This new funding will help ensure that all children get vaccinated to eradicate polio, while strengthening community-based health systems. No child should suffer from an easily preventable disease.' Specifically, the funding partnership is expected to include: **€500 million in new funding for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative **(as outlined above) €500 million in investments and grants to ensure health innovations are more accessible, strengthen health systems and prepare for future pandemics : The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation plans to provide €250 million of grants and investments to match a €250 million in investments made by the European Investment Bank and guaranteed by the European Fund for Sustainable Development plus. €80 million grants for Technical Assistance: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation expects to match €40 million in grants from the European Commission to provide technical assistance and ensure that global health programs achieve their full potential. The partnership announced today builds from existing partnerships between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Commission and Member States, including a €100 million support package for the recently established African Medicines Agency (AMA) and national African medicines regulatory agencies or regional initiatives, the African Health Diagnostics Platform, which supports African partners to increase access and reduce costs of laboratory testing, and coordination on health initiatives such as COVAX , a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

423343682,"WHO releases updated guidance on adolescent health and well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) is releasing the second edition of its Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) guidance. The document aims to equip governments to respond to the health and well-being challenges, opportunities and needs of adolescents. The guidance provides the latest available data on adolescent health and well-being. It also outlines an updated list of core indicators that data should be collected on. Globally, road injury was the top cause of death for adolescent males in 2019. Among female adolescents, the leading causes of death were diarrhoeal diseases among the younger group (10-14 years) and tuberculosis (TB) in the older group (15-19 years). Over the last 20 years, mortality rates have declined among adolescents globally, with the largest decline in older (1519 years) adolescent girls. For non-fatal diseases, the burden has not improved over the past two decades, with the main causes of ill health in this category being: mental health conditions (depressive and anxiety disorders, childhood behavioural disorders), iron deficiency anaemia, skin diseases and migraine. Adolescent well-being depends on a range of factors, including healthy food, education, life skills and employability, connectedness, feeling valued by society, safe and supportive environments, resilience, and the freedom to make choices. To take an appropriately holistic approach, the guidance outlines how to take crosscutting action to support adolescent health and well-being, with mutually reinforcing interventions across sectors, such as health, education, social protection, and telecommunications. Targeted efforts are also required to engage adolescents, as they trust health systems less than adults do and are especially vulnerable to modern-day trends, like online bullying and gaming. There has been substantial progress since the launch of the guidance’s first edition in 2017. A range of World Health Assembly resolutions address these issues, spanning areas such as the health workforce, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), emergencies, and water and sanitation. New initiatives have been established, such as the    in 2018 and the Joint Programme on Mental Health and Psychosocial Wellbeing and Development of Children and Adolescents launched by WHO and UNICEF in 2020. “Informed by the AA-HA! guidance, many more governments are investing in comprehensive and evidence-based adolescent health and well-being programmes, developed in close consultation with adolescents and youth,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent and Ageing. “The commitment to collaboration and working closely with young people catalysed by the first edition can be seen in WHO’s strengthened partnerships with other UN agencies and the newly created WHO Youth Council.” This new version of the AA-HA! guidance also includes an updated package of evidence-based interventions and advises governments on how to set national priorities, implement programmes, and conduct monitoring, evaluation and research. Evidence shows that the smartest investments are coordinated investments in health and education that reinforce each other. The second edition is distinct for integrating the concept of well-being, expanding from a largely health-centric to a more holistic approach to adolescents. It also incorporates learnings from both the application of the first edition and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that the role of schools goes well beyond education to providing critical nutrition, social protection, mental health and other services. The guidance also makes the case for investment in adolescent health and wellbeing. An investment of US$ 1 in adolescent well-being brings a return of US$ 5-10, sometimes more, and putting resources into preventing NCDs during adolescence would yield US$ 400 billion in economic benefits over 50 years globally. This guidance was developed by WHO in collaboration with global partners, including UN Women, UNAIDS, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP and PMNCH.",9367,release update guidance adolescent health world health organization release second edition global accelerated action health adolescents aa ha guidance document aim equip government respond health challenge opportunity need adolescent guidance provide late available datum adolescent health outline update list core indicator datum collect globally road injury cause death adolescent male female adolescent lead cause death diarrhoeal disease young group year tuberculosis tb old group year year mortality rate decline adolescent globally large decline old year adolescent girl non fatal disease burden improve past decade main cause ill health category mental health condition depressive anxiety disorder childhood behavioural disorder iron deficiency anaemia skin disease migraine adolescent depend range factor include healthy food education life skill employability connectedness feeling value society safe supportive environment resilience freedom choice appropriately holistic approach guidance outline crosscut action support adolescent health mutually reinforce intervention sector health education social protection telecommunication targeted effort require engage adolescent trust health system adult especially vulnerable modern day trend like online bullying gaming substantial progress launch guidance edition range world health assembly resolution address issue span area health workforce noncommunicable disease ncd emergency water sanitation new initiative establish joint programme mental health psychosocial wellbeing development children adolescents launch unicef inform aa ha guidance government invest comprehensive evidence base adolescent health programme develop close consultation adolescent youth say dr anshu banerjee director maternal newborn child adolescent ageing commitment collaboration work closely young people catalyse edition see strengthen partnership un agency newly create youth council new version aa ha guidance include update package evidence base intervention advise government set national priority implement programme conduct monitoring evaluation research evidence show smart investment coordinate investment health education reinforce second edition distinct integrate concept expand largely health centric holistic approach adolescent incorporate learning application edition pandemic example pandemic highlight role school go education provide critical nutrition social protection mental health service guidance make case investment adolescent health wellbeing investment adolescent bring return put resource prevent ncd adolescence yield billion economic benefit year globally guidance develop collaboration global partner include un women unaids unesco unfpa unicef wfp pmnch

'But the progress we have made against the disease is fragile, and we cannot afford to lose focus. 'Millions of children are still missing out on vaccination because of pandemic-related disruptions, conflict, climate disasters, displacement, and increasing vaccine misinformation. 'Most of these children live in the poorest and most marginalized communities with limited access to life saving vaccination and health services. These are also the places where the polio virus continues to thrive and spread. 'The €500 million in funding announced by the partnership today will be critical to our efforts to vaccinate these children against polio. It will also be essential to support the strengthening of community-based health systems for the delivery of more equitable primary health care over the long term. 'Moving forward, we will continue to focus on the timely delivery of vaccines to countries in need that’s over a billion doses of polio vaccines every year. 'And we will also increase our support to community health workers. They are on the frontlines every day, working to vaccinate children, building trust in vaccine efficacy, and engaging with local leaders.

423325089,"AFGHANISTAN. On 7 October, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck 40km west of Herat City in Herat Province, western Afghanistan. Several aftershocks have occurred since of varying magnitude, with the initial quake felt in neighbouring Badghis and Farah provinces. As of 8 October, reports indicated that 1,023 people have been killed and 1,663 injured in 11 villages of the Zindajan District in Herat Province, where it is estimated that 100 per cent of the homes have been completely destroyed and another 516 people (203 men and 213 women) are reported missing. At least 11,585 people (1,655 families) are reported to have been directly affected by the earthquake across Zindajan (1,320 families), Injil (150 families), Gulran (95 families), Kohsan (60 families) and Kushk (30 families) districts of Herat Province. Assessments are ongoing with casualties and numbers of affected people expected to rise further. PAPUA NEW GUINEA. A series of earthquakes have struck communities in Madang Province and have affected an estimated 25,000 people. On 7 October, an 6.7 magnitude earthquake at a depth of 74 km struck 56 kilometres Southeast of Madang Province. Two substantial aftershocks ensued within 1 hour, measuring 6.9Mat a depth of 71 km, and another registering 5.4M at a depth of 114 km. The earthquakes affected over 150 villages comprising an estimated 25,000 people. The earthquake also inflicted infrastructural damages including on power lines in various areas of Madang, resulting in widespread power outages. Humanitarian partners continue to liaise closely with provincial and national authorities and actors on the ground to monitor the situation closely. MYANMAR. Almost two million people are now displaced across Myanmar including 1.7 million people who have fled their homes as a result of conflict and insecurity since February 2021. On 9 October, dozens of civilians, including internally displaced persons, many of them women and children, were killed and more than 50 were injured in a bombing near the town of Laiza in Kachin State. The explosions affected a village, and an adjacent displacement camp which hosts more than 6,000 people. From 26 September to 1 October, about 4,800 people were newly displaced in the Southeast, while Sagaing and Magway in the Northwest witnessed armed clashes, forcing 13,000 people to flee in late September. The situation is dire in Hpruso Township in Kayah, where fighting has prompted people to seek refuge in forests, where they are in urgent need of shelter, food, and other essential items. People along the Shan-Kayah border continue to face critical shortages of life-saving supplies, with major roads blocked since late September, impeding humanitarian access. Humanitarians continue to respond to emerging needs, reaching at least 1.8 million people during the first half of 2023, including 700,000 displaced people reached.

423332548,"Summary. The United Nations Secretary General adopted his Guidance Note on Transitional Justice: A Strategic Tool for People, Prevention and Peace in June 2023. The new Guidance Note is a result of a cross-pillar project under the auspices of Executive Office of the Secretary General and co-leadership of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It followed an extensive consultative process with all relevant United Nations entities and offices. The Guidance Note promotes transitional justice as a pragmatic human rights-based policy tool at the disposal of national stakeholders that is relevant to enhancing peace and security, human rights and accountability, and sustainable development. It aims to achieve greater innovation in the design and implementation of the Organization’s transitional justice work and support to national stakeholders and to contribute to tangible and transformational impact for people and communities. The Guidance Note sets out key features of the United Nations approach to transitional justice: 1 Normative (basing assistance on and promoting compliance with international norms and standards); 2 Strategic (encouraging innovative solutions tailored to the context, fit for purpose, with a holistic and long-term perspective, and coordinated with other reform process); 3 Inclusive (empowering victims, involving the marginalized, adopting a transgenerational and child-sensitive lens, and fostering community ownership); 4 Gender-responsive (adopting and consistently advocating for a gender-responsive approach, including by promoting women’s leadership and addressing the gendered dimension of root causes of violations); and. 5 Transformative (supporting a transformative project that seeks to address structural causes and contributors to conflict and violations and make a tangible difference in people’s lives). Grounded on these key features, the Guidance Note includes recommendations to operationalize the United Nations support to transitional justice, namely to adjust institutional understanding and positioning of transitional justice; to become more innovative in the design and implementation of transitional justice work; and to reinvigorate the victim and people-centeredness of transitional justice, seeking to make an early, tangible and transformational impact for people and communities. The United Nations promotes a holistic approach to transitional justice, understanding the key elements of comprehensive transitional justice processes (truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence) as interrelated. Broad and meaningful consultations throughout the process are critical in informing coherent policies on how the rights and aspirations of people can be satisfied.",9367,summary united nations secretary general adopt guidance note transitional justice strategic tool people prevention peace june new guidance note result cross pillar project auspex executive office secretary general co leadership office high commissioner human rights follow extensive consultative process relevant united nations entity office guidance note promote transitional justice pragmatic human right base policy tool disposal national stakeholder relevant enhance peace security human right accountability sustainable development aim achieve great innovation design implementation organization transitional justice work support national stakeholder contribute tangible transformational impact people community guidance note set key feature united nations approach transitional justice normative base assistance promote compliance international norm standard strategic encourage innovative solution tailor context fit purpose holistic long term perspective coordinate reform process inclusive empower victim involve marginalize adopt transgenerational child sensitive len foster community ownership gender responsive adopt consistently advocate gender responsive approach include promote woman leadership address gendered dimension root cause violation transformative support transformative project seek address structural cause contributor conflict violation tangible difference people life ground key feature guidance note include recommendation operationalize united nations support transitional justice adjust institutional understanding positioning transitional justice innovative design implementation transitional justice work reinvigorate victim people centeredness transitional justice seek early tangible transformational impact people community united nations promote holistic approach transitional justice understand key element comprehensive transitional justice process truth justice reparation guarantee non recurrence interrelate broad meaningful consultation process critical inform coherent policy right aspiration people satisfied
423333208,"About this manual. This manual provides NGO security staff with resources to support them in developing and facilitating effective crisis management exercises for strengthening an organization’s crisis response capability. The manual complements other essential GISF resources such as Crisis Management of Critical Incidents, Family First: Liaison and support during a crisis and Managing the Message: Communication and media management in a security crisis which provide guidance on the management of critical incidents. The manual is organized into four sections, each covering a crucial aspect of the exercise development and facilitation process, with practical guidance and useful tools to support each stage of the process. Who is the manual for? The manual is aimed principally at security leads within international development, humanitarian, human rights, and peace and democracy organizations who are looking to facilitate crisis management exercises for other organizations, as part of a peer-to-peer exchange. However, it is equally relevant for those looking to undertake or facilitate exercises within their own organizations. Whether you are new to facilitating crisis management exercises and looking for helpful hints, or seeking ideas to enhance your existing exercises, the manual provides practical guidance and useful insights into the design, preparation, delivery, and learning from crisis management exercises. Introduction. The threats confronting aid workers are rising significantly. The environments in which NGO staff travel and work delivering programs around the world present considerable risks to their security, safety, health and wellbeing. In the face of such threats, organizations have a duty to ensure an effective and timely response to critical incidents and emergency situations involving their staff, wherever they occur. Whilst each incident is unique and requires a tailored response, it is paramount that before an incident occurs, measures and capacities are in place that will enable an organization to effectively manage potential crisis situations. Preparation, through a combination of detailed plans, trained staff, and specialist support, is vital for the successful management of any incident, especially where a coordinated, effective response involving different locations and stakeholders is required. Crisis Management Exercises (CMEs) are an integral component of an organization’s preparedness strategy. Having a plan is not merely enough; organizations also need to ‘learn by doing’. Crisis Management Teams (CMTs) need the opportunity to practice potential responses and test various assumptions to ensure they can coordinate and respond effectively to critical incidents. Learning from exercises, and identifying gaps in plans prior to a real incident, can significantly strengthen an organization’s crisis management capabilities, and ultimately help ensure a more positive outcome.",9367,manual manual provide ngo security staff resource support develop facilitate effective crisis management exercise strengthen organization crisis response capability manual complement essential gisf resource crisis management critical incidents family liaison support crisis manage message communication medium management security crisis provide guidance management critical incident manual organize section cover crucial aspect exercise development facilitation process practical guidance useful tool support stage process manual manual aim principally security lead international development humanitarian human right peace democracy organization look facilitate crisis management exercise organization peer peer exchange equally relevant look undertake facilitate exercise organization new facilitate crisis management exercise look helpful hint seek idea enhance exist exercise manual provide practical guidance useful insight design preparation delivery learn crisis management exercise introduction threat confront aid worker rise significantly environment ngo staff travel work deliver program world present considerable risk security safety health wellbeing face threat organization duty ensure effective timely response critical incident emergency situation involve staff occur whilst incident unique require tailor response paramount incident occur measure capacity place enable organization effectively manage potential crisis situation preparation combination detailed plan train staff specialist support vital successful management incident especially coordinate effective response involve different location stakeholder require crisis management exercises cmes integral component organization preparedness strategy have plan merely organization need learn crisis management teams cmt need opportunity practice potential response test assumption ensure coordinate respond effectively critical incident learn exercise identify gap plan prior real incident significantly strengthen organization crisis management capability ultimately help ensure positive outcome
423333927,"Introduction. Respect for human rights is a critical foundation of strong democratic societies. Yet, while their fundamental importance is universally recognized, human rights continue to be under strain across the world. International and national conflicts, humanitarian crises, rising authoritarianism, racism and xenophobia, climate change, widening inequalities and, most recently, a global pandemic all pose formidable challenges and underscore the need for parliaments to double their efforts to place human rights at the centre of their work. What contribution can parliaments make in this regard? Parliaments have a central role to play in building strong national human rights protection systems by adopting human rights-sensitive laws, by supporting the ratification of human rights treaties, by holding governments to account and by approving national budgets that promote human rights. Parliaments are also well-positioned to work with national and international human rights stakeholders, and to implement, directly and indirectly, international human rights standards, with a full understanding of the local context. Against this backdrop, this self-assessment toolkit sets out to assist parliaments in assessing the extent to which international human rights norms and mechanisms are fully known inside parliament and are integrated into parliamentary processes, procedures and structures. This internal reflection exercise should empower parliaments to identify good practices, gaps and lessons learned, and enable them to chart a course of action to ensure better awareness and mainstreaming of human rights in their work. The publication draws on the extensive experience of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in supporting national parliaments through human rights capacitybuilding activities, and is aligned with the IPU Common Principles for Support to Parliaments, which empower parliaments to take ownership of their own development. It is also intended to complement the joint IPU and OHCHR publication Human Rights: Handbook for Parliamentarians No. 26. The toolkit has been designed to be relevant to all parliaments, irrespective of their political system. In addition, it aims to support parliaments in ensuring that the recommendations of international human rights mechanisms are taken into account in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, given the link between human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The self-assessment is a voluntary exercise and is not intended to rank parliaments. Parliaments do not need to discuss all the questions proposed and they are highly encouraged to tailor the toolkit to fit their national context. Moreover, the effectiveness of the self-assessment derives from parliament’s level of commitment and willingness to reflect on how human rights norms and mechanisms are integrated into parliamentary work, and to take the necessary follow-up action that emerges from this exercise in order to strengthen the protection and promotion of human rights. Therefore, leading and taking part in a self-assessment exercise provides a unique opportunity for parliaments to work together in an inclusive environment to set their human rights goals.",9367,introduction respect human right critical foundation strong democratic society fundamental importance universally recognize human right continue strain world international national conflict humanitarian crisis rise authoritarianism racism xenophobia climate change widen inequality recently global pandemic pose formidable challenge underscore need parliament double effort place human right centre work contribution parliament regard parliament central role play build strong national human right protection system adopt human right sensitive law support ratification human right treaty hold government account approve national budget promote human right parliament position work national international human right stakeholder implement directly indirectly international human right standard understanding local context backdrop self assessment toolkit set assist parliament assess extent international human right norm mechanism fully know inside parliament integrate parliamentary process procedure structure internal reflection exercise empower parliament identify good practice gap lesson learn enable chart course action ensure well awareness mainstreaming human right work publication draw extensive experience inter parliamentary union ipu office united nations high commissioner human rights ohchr support national parliament human right capacitybuilde activity align ipu common principles support parliaments empower parliament ownership development intend complement joint ipu ohchr publication human rights handbook parliamentarians toolkit design relevant parliament irrespective political system addition aim support parliament ensure recommendation international human right mechanism take account implementation agenda sustainable development give link human right sustainable development goals sdg self assessment voluntary exercise intend rank parliament parliament need discuss question propose highly encouraged tailor toolkit fit national context effectiveness self assessment derive parliament level commitment willingness reflect human right norm mechanism integrate parliamentary work necessary follow action emerge exercise order strengthen protection promotion human right lead take self assessment exercise provide unique opportunity parliament work inclusive environment set human right goal
423334560,"Introduction. Le respect des droits humains est un élément essentiel de toute société démocratique forte. Pourtant, si leur importance fondamentale est universellement reconnue, les droits humains continuent à être en proie à des tensions dans le monde entier. Conflits nationaux et internationaux, crises humanitaires, montée de l’autoritarisme, du racisme et de la xénophobie, changements climatiques, aggravation des inégalités et, plus récemment, une pandémie mondiale sont autant d’éléments qui posent des difficultés colossales et qui mettent en exergue la nécessité pour les parlements de redoubler d’efforts afin de placer les droits humains au cur de leur action. Quelle peut-être la contribution des parlements à cet égard ? Ils ont un rôle central à jouer pour ce qui est de créer des systèmes de protection des droits humains robustes en adoptant des lois sensibles aux droits humains, en soutenant la ratification de traités en la matière, en demandant des comptes aux gouvernements et en approuvant des budgets nationaux qui les promeuvent. Ils sont aussi bien placés pour travailler avec des acteurs nationaux et internationaux des droits humains et mettre en uvre, directement ou indirectement, les normes internationales pertinentes, grâce à une compréhension parfaite du contexte local. Dans ce contexte, cet outil d’auto-évaluation vise à aider les parlements à évaluer l’étendue de la connaissance des normes et mécanismes internationaux des droits humains en leur sein et leur degré d’intégration dans les processus, procédures et structures parlementaires. Cet exercice de réflexion interne doit permettre aux parlements de recenser les bonnes pratiques, les lacunes et les leçons tirées et de déterminer la voie à suivre pour veiller à une meilleure compréhension des droits humains et à leur intégration pleine et entière dans les travaux parlementaires. Cette publication s’appuie sur l’expérience considérable de l’Union interparlementaire (UIP) et du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme (HCDH) en ce qui concerne le soutien apporté aux parlements nationaux au moyen d’activités de renforcement des capacités dans le domaine des droits humains. Elle se conforme en outre aux Principes communs en matière d’assistance aux parlements de l’UIP, qui leur donnent le contrôle de leur propre développement. Elle a également vocation à compléter la publication conjointe de l’UIP et du HCDH intitulée Droits de l’homme : Guide à l’usage des parlementaires n 26. Cet outil a été conçu pour être utile à tous les parlements, quel que soit leur système politique. En outre, il vise à les aider à veiller à ce que les recommandations des mécanismes internationaux des droits humains soient prises en considération dans la mise en uvre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030 (Programme 2030), considérant le lien entre droits humains et Objectifs de développement durable (ODD). Cette auto-évaluation est un exercice volontaire et n’a pas vocation à classer les parlements.

423335168,"Introducción. El respeto por los derechos humanos es el fundamento esencial de las sociedades democráticas sólidas. Aun así, aunque se reconoce universalmente su importancia fundamental, los derechos humanos continúan estando sometidos a presión en todo el mundo. Los conflictos nacionales e internacionales, las crisis humanitarias, el aumento del autoritarismo, el racismo y la xenofobia, el cambio climático, la expansión de las desigualdades y, más recientemente, la pandemia mundial constituyen desafíos formidables y subrayan la necesidad de que los parlamentos dupliquen sus esfuerzos para situar a los derechos humanos en el centro de su labor. Qué pueden aportar los parlamentos a este respecto? Los parlamentos desempeñan una función central en la construcción de sistemas nacionales sólidos de protección de los derechos humanos adoptando leyes que tengan en cuenta los derechos humanos, respaldando la ratificación de tratados de derechos humanos, exigiendo responsabilidades a los Gobiernos y aprobando presupuestos nacionales que promuevan los derechos humanos. Además, los parlamentos ocupan una posición excelente a la hora de trabajar con las partes interesadas, nacionales e internacionales, en materia de derechos humanos, y de implementar, directa o indirectamente, las normas internacionales de derechos humanos con plena comprensión del contexto local. Con este telón de fondo, la presente herramienta de autoevaluación tiene el propósito de ayudar a los parlamentos a evaluar hasta qué punto los mecanismos y las normas internacionales de derechos humanos son plenamente conocidos dentro del parlamento y están integrados en las estructuras, los procedimientos y los procesos parlamentarios. Este ejercicio interno de reflexión debería empoderar a los parlamentos para que identifiquen buenas prácticas, deficiencias y lecciones aprendidas, además de facilitarles trazar un curso de acción que asegure una mejor comprensión e integración de los derechos humanos en su labor. La presente publicación se fundamenta en la amplia experiencia de la Unión Interparlamentaria (UIP) y la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos (ACNUDH) brindando asistencia a los parlamentos nacionales mediante actividades de desarrollo de la capacidad en materia de derechos humanos, y se encuentra en consonancia con los Principios Comunes en materia de asistencia a los parlamentos de la UIP, los cuales empoderan a los parlamentos para que se transformen en autores de su propio desarrollo. Está concebida también para servir de complemento a la publicación conjunta de la UIP y ACNUDH titulada Derechos Humanos. Manual para Parlamentarios N 26. Esta herramienta ha sido diseñada con el propósito de ser relevante para todos los parlamentos, independientemente de su sistema político. Además, tiene también por objetivo apoyar a los parlamentos a la hora de garantizar que las recomendaciones formuladas por los mecanismos internacionales de derechos humanos se tomen en cuenta en la aplicación de la Agenda 2030 para el Desarrollo Sostenible, dado el vínculo entre los derechos humanos y los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS). La autoevaluación es un ejercicio voluntario que no pretende establecer una clasificación de parlamentos. No es necesario que los parlamentos debatan todas las cuestiones propuestas, sino que más bien se les anima encarecidamente a que adapten la herramienta para que se ajuste a su contexto nacional. Asimismo, la eficacia de la autoevaluación deriva del grado de compromiso del parlamento y de la disposición a reflexionar sobre el modo en que los mecanismos y las normas de derechos humanos se encuentran integrados en la labor parlamentaria, además de la adopción de las medidas de seguimiento necesarias que surjan de este ejercicio, con el fin de fortalecer la protección y promoción de los derechos humanos. Por lo tanto, participar en un ejercicio de autoevaluación y liderarlo constituyen una oportunidad única para que los parlamentos trabajen juntos en un entorno inclusivo de cara a fijar sus objetivos en materia de derechos humanos.",9367,introducción el respeto por los derechos humanos es el fundamento esencial de las sociedade democráticas sólida aun así aunque se reconoce universalmente su importancia fundamental los derechos humanos continúan estando sometido presión en todo el mundo los conflictos nacionale e internacionale las crisis humanitarias el aumento del autoritarismo el racismo y la xenofobia el cambio climático la expansión de las desigualdade y más recientemente la pandemia mundial constituyen desafíos formidable y subrayan la necesidad de que los parlamentos dupliquen sus esfuerzos para situar los derechos humanos en el centro de su labor qué pueden aportar los parlamentos este respecto los parlamento desempeñan una función central en la construcción de sistemas nacionales sólidos de protección de los derechos humanos adoptando leyes que tengan en cuenta los derechos humanos respaldando la ratificación de tratados de derechos humano exigiendo responsabilidade los gobiernos y aprobando presupuestos nacionale que promuevan los derechos humano además los parlamentos ocupan una posición excelente la hora de trabajar con las parte interesada nacionale e internacionale en materia de derechos humano y de implementar directa o indirectamente las normas internacionale de derechos humanos con plena comprensión del contexto local con este telón de fondo la presente herramienta de autoevaluación tiene el propósito de ayudar los parlamentos evaluar hasta qué punto los mecanismos y las normas internacionale de derechos humanos son plenamente conocido dentro del parlamento y están integrado en las estructura los procedimientos y los procesos parlamentario este ejercicio interno de reflexión debería empoderar los parlamentos para que identifiquen buenas prácticas deficiencias y leccione aprendidas además de facilitarles trazar un curso de acción que asegure una mejor comprensión e integración de los derechos humanos en su labor la presente publicación se fundamenta en la amplia experiencia de la unión interparlamentaria uip y la oficina del alto comisionado de las naciones unidas para los derechos humanos acnudh brindando asistencia los parlamentos nacionale mediante actividade de desarrollo de la capacidad en materia de derechos humano y se encuentra en consonancia con los principios comunes en materia de asistencia los parlamentos de la uip los cuale empoderan los parlamentos para que se transforman en autore de su propio desarrollo está concebida también para servir de complemento la publicación conjunta de la uip y acnudh titulada derechos humanos manual para parlamentarios n esta herramienta ha sido diseñada con el propósito de ser relevante para todo los parlamentos independientemente de su sistema político además tiene también por objetivo apoyar los parlamentos la hora de garantizar que las recomendaciones formuladas por los mecanismos internacionale de derechos humano se toman en cuenta en la aplicación de la agenda para el desarrollo sostenible dado el vínculo entre los derechos humanos y los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible ods la autoevaluación es un ejercicio voluntario que pretende establecer una clasificación de parlamento es necesario que los parlamentos debatan todas las cuestiones propuesta sino que más bien se les anima encarecidamente que adapten la herramienta para que se ajuste su contexto nacional asimismo la eficacia de la autoevaluación deriva del grado de compromiso del parlamento y de la disposición reflexionar sobre el modo en que los mecanismos y las normas de derechos humanos se encuentran integrado en la labor parlamentaria además de la adopción de las medidas de seguimiento necesarias que surjan de este ejercicio con el fin de fortalecer la protección y promoción de los derechos humano por lo tanto participar en un ejercicio de autoevaluación y liderarlo constituyen una oportunidad única para que los parlamentos trabajen juntos en un entorno inclusivo de cara fijar sus objetivos en materia de derechos humano

423359462,"Programs focus on achieving gender equality. , the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco, joins humanitarian organizations and countries around the globe in honoring International Day of the Girl on Oct. 11. The day, first held in 2012, was established to promote equal treatment and opportunities for girls and is an acknowledgment by the world that there is a disparity in the way rights of girls and boys are protected and promoted. The United Nations has noted, 'Nearly 1 in 4 girls aged 15-19 globally are not in education, employment or training, compared to 1 in 10 boys. Yet, every day, girls are breaking boundaries and barriers, tackling issues like child marriage, education inequality, violence, climate justice, and inequitable access to health care. Girls are proving they are unstoppable.' Salesian missionaries living and working in more than 130 countries around the globe are focused on achieving gender equality through educational programs targeted specifically for girls. 'Salesians know that it's more difficult for girls to access education, so we are ensuring young girls can go to school and learn the skills for self-sufficiency,' said Father Timothy Ploch, interim director of Salesian Missions. 'Salesian educational centers foster safe learning environments for girls and encourage them to continue to advanced education and skills training so they can become leaders in their families and communities.' To mark International Day of the Girl, Salesian Missions is proud to highlight programs around the globe that empower girls through education and social supports. BOLIVIA. Salesian missionaries offer schools and social development programs across Bolivia to ensure youth have access to education and hope for a brighter future. In Cochabamba, Salesians operate Hogar Maria Auxiliadora, where young girls seek shelter and an education. The long-term residential home provides a safe, structured setting where young girls can grow into independent and self-sufficient young women. As many as 45 girls ages 2-17 live there at any given time. Eden Gordon, a Salesian lay missioner who has served twice at Hogar Maria Auxiliadora, was determined to help one young girl who had been abandoned. Veronica arrived when she was just 6 years old, abandoned by her parents without understanding why. Gordon knew she needed to reassure Veronica of her worth, so she played a daily game with the little girl in the weeks leading up to her move into the residence. Gordon would ask Veronica when she was coming to live at the Hogar and tell her that she was excited and waiting for her arrival. It became a happy game the two played when they spoke. The game instilled such confidence that on the day of her move, Veronica marched in with a big grin on her face. Gordon even nicknamed her Querida, from the Spanish 'to love.' Every time she hears it, Veronica understands its truth. ECUADOR. Salesian missionaries in Machala, Ecuador , provide technical education for at-risk young people from low-income sectors in the city. Salesians also supported 20 small family business initiatives to improve the living conditions of the beneficiaries. The project was supported by the Salesian Mission Office in Madrid, the ADEY Foundation and the Our Lady of Mercy Parish in Ecuador. The goal was to reduce poverty by strengthening technical skills and promoting family and entrepreneurship for young people ages 18-35. Courses focused mostly on young women who are migrants, mainly from Venezuela, and Ecuadorian citizens experiencing social exclusion, including single mothers and economically dependent women. With lower levels of education, these young women face the greatest barriers to accessing training and employment. Education included courses in gastronomy, cosmetics and cell phone repair, which were held at three different times. Each course included 108 hours of face-to-face lectures on technical topics, 12 hours of lectures on peace culture, entrepreneurship and business models, and 24 hours of hands-on individual work that was done at home. A total of 218 students participated in the courses, with 68% of the students women and 32% men. Of the students, 56% were from Ecuador and 44% were migrants. PAKISTAN. Salesian missionaries provide social development and educational services to poor youth and their families in centers in Lahore and Quetta, Pakistan. Salesian schools provide economic benefits, scholarships and accommodations for students from the poorest families so that education is not only accessible but also an incentive for parents to send their children to school. Salesians provide training programs focused on educating girls and young women about their rights with the aim of creating and spreading awareness and self-determination. Salesians encourage girls and young women to continue their studies. They also organize courses to impart knowledge and skills aimed at learning a trade. One of the students said, 'If we study, we can have a brighter future.' Salesian school fees are very low, since most families have one income to support many children. Scholarships are needed so that students can complete their education and skills training in order to become independent members of society. One of the educational facilities is the Don Bosco Learning Center, within the Don Bosco Quetta community. The center has been teaching primary and secondary school in Quetta since 2000. More than 780 students, ages 8-22, attend this center. Students also have access to a computer lab to learn technology skills in order to compete in the current labor market. SIERRA LEONE. St. Augustine Agricultural Junior Secondary School, located in Lungi, Sierra Leone , received support from donor funding from Salesian Missions. The school, which was established in 1984, has 14 classrooms, a computer lab, an infirmary/clinic and an administrative building. The school provides education to marginalized students in the region. It currently has 700 students, 34 teachers and four auxiliary staff, including a nurse. Given the economic condition of the country and the challenges faced by students, the school recently reintroduced its feeding program. A portion of the donor funding went to support this program and ensure students in need have access to healthy nutrition through school lunch. In addition, funding provided for school uniforms and to support salaries for the auxiliary staff. Maintenance and repairs of the school buildings, assembly and sport grounds, school fence, bathrooms and canteen also took place with the funding. At the school, Salesian sports programming provides much-needed recreation and life skills for the students. Funding provided for table tennis equipment, balls, and jerseys for soccer, basketball and volleyball.

423286481,"Joint Press Release. MANILA, 10 Oct. 2023 Ahead of the International Day of the Girl Child, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in partnership with the Australian Government, the United Nations Children’s Funds (UNICEF), the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and the University of San Carlos - Office of Population Studies (USC-OPS), launched the Phase III implementation of the Longitudinal Cohort Study on the Filipino Child. This unique study tracked the development of Filipino children over 15 years. It followed the same group of 5,000 children from age 10 in 2016 until the end of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2030. “This [launch] and this study is a timely reminder of the importance of investing in the health, education, and well-being of adolescent girls,” said UNFPA Country Representative Dr. Leila Joudane. “We are at that crucial point in time when the children covered by the study are going through the tumultuous and crucial period of adolescence, when they develop knowledge and skills, learn to manage emotions and relationships, and acquire abilities that will be important for them as they become productive members of society.” Thanh Le PSM, the Australian Embassy’s Development Counsellor, emphasised the importance of the greater dissemination of the study’s findings to help inform policymakers address the needs of Filipino children and girls. “This study will help put girls at the centre of decision-making efforts, which aligns with Australia’s International Development Policy that also prioritises addressing gender equality. And so Australia is pleased to announce our continued support for a third phase of the Filipino child Cohort Study.” “As we launch the third phase of the Longitudinal Cohort Study on the Filipino Child and celebrate the International Day of the Girl Child, we remember all the girls who are still unable to complete their education, access comprehensive health and nutrition services, and live free from gender-based violence and harmful practices. As girls call for change, we must move beyond reaffirming commitments and make bold investments for their rights”, UNICEF Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov said. During the launch, researchers from USC-OPS shared key findings from the study. They pointed out that girls fared better during the first six years of the study for example: During their earlier years, teenage boys are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as smoking and drinking alcohol than teenage girls. At age 13 to 14, 7.7% of boys have tried smoking, compared to only 2.5% of girls. Similarly, 21.8% of boys have tried drinking alcohol, compared to 12.8% of girls. In terms of education, at age 16, girls are more likely to be on track with their schooling than boys (85% of girls vs. 75% of boys). This means more girls were in age-appropriate grades, were not delayed or repeated a school year. The researchers noted, however, that the study also shows the unique challenges related to gender norms and stereotypes that could significantly impact the futures of girls. Data gathered at age 15 to 16 of the respondents showed that 2.6% of the girls have already experienced early pregnancy while 3% are already cohabiting or living with their partners, compared to only 1% of the boys. And while the majority are asked to perform household chores, unequal gender norms or stereotypes are observed as girls spend more time (40% more) on such tasks when compared to boys. This might mean they have less time for studying or rest. “We already know from other national studies that women are less likely to be able to participate economically and in decision-making during adulthood. Our cohort study aims to learn why this happens and what factors contribute to girls losing their edge as they reach adulthood. We are hopeful that the study will generate insights that will help stakeholders provide solutions and enable women to realize their full potential,” said one of the study’s researchers Dr. Nanette Lee-Mayol, Director of the University of San Carlos - Office of the Population Studies Foundation, Inc. As the sexual and reproductive health agency of the United Nations, UNFPA pointed out that ensuring that adolescent girls “have access to comprehensive sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health services will benefit not just their adult life but also our society and the next generation of children.” Joudane said the challenge for them now is to work closely with the government and other development partners to use the rich data and information from the study to reduce the structural barriers to services for adolescents and to address factors that cause high rates of adolescent pregnancy, child marriage, mental health disorders and violence against girls.

423287204,"The Tunisian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release six political opposition figures who have been arbitrarily detained for nearly eight months solely for their peaceful political activism on unfounded accusations of “conspiracy against state security” and drop all charges against them and others facing similar charges, said Amnesty International. The six detainees include opposition activist Jaouhar Ben Mbarek, politician Khayam Turki, dissident and politician Abdelhamid Jlassi, opposition activist Issam Chebbi, and the lawyers Ghazi Chaouachi and Ridha Bel Hadj. All had been held under an initial pre-trial detention order of six months which was renewed by the investigative judge after it expired on 22 August. Last week, Ben Mbarek announced a hunger strike to denounce his arbitrary detention. Prominent human rights lawyer Ayachi Hammami, who is being investigated in the same case for similar accusations as his detained clients, was summoned to attend interrogation by the investigative judge this morning 10 October in a signal that authorities have renewed their efforts to pursue this case. “The Tunisian authorities have carried out a political witch-hunt rounding up opposition figures and misusing the judicial system to suppress the right to freedom of expression and crackdown on political dissent They have for seven months thrown opposition politicians and dissident activists in prolonged pre-trial detention which should be reserved for exceptional cases, not wielded as a weapon against peaceful activists. The continued arbitrary detention of the six political detainees is a travesty and must stop,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Director for the Middle East and North Africa. On 2 October, Tunisian authorities also brought criminal charges against two of the detainees’ lawyers in two separate legal cases. “The growing crackdown and judicial harassment of lawyers caught up in this case is one of the deeply disturbing features of the past months. Instead of opening new investigations against the lawyers of people arbitrarily detained, Tunisian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release all the defendants and immediately drop the unfounded charges and accusations against them. This is a politically motivated case that must end along with the authorities’ impunity and shameful campaign of repression,” said Heba Morayef. Hammami’s interrogation follows that of Mohamed Hamdi, Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, Riadh Chaibi, Noureddine Bhiri, and other opposition political activists who are being investigated in this case, indicating that the judge may have now investigated almost all defendants which would allow him to decide on an indictment. Defense lawyers have appealed against the pre-trial detention orders and filed multiple requests for provisional release, but the investigative judge repeatedly refused the requests. Prosecution of opposition leaders and their lawyers. On 2 October, the Tunis Court of First Instance general prosecutor referred Lawyers Islem Hamza and Dalila Ben Mbarek Msaddak for investigation after they made statements to the media on 28 and on 29 September respectively. During a radio interview Hamza said that the charges against her clients were fabricated and that the aim of the investigation was to silence political opposition. Also, during a radio interview, Msaddak explained the lawyers’ request to subpoena the testimonies of foreign diplomats with whom detainees are accused of having exchanged intelligence. They are being investigated in connection with charges under Decree law 54 and Law 63 of 2004 on Protection of Personal Data and risk heavy prison sentences if convicted. The defence team of the detainees is composed of seven lawyers, three of which have been targeted by criminal investigations in relation to their peaceful expression about this case. Islem Hamza had already been referred for investigation under decree law 54 on 14 June 2023 in relation to a media statement she made in her capacity as a defence lawyer, criticizing the transportation conditions of the detainees to and from the prison. Another lawyer, also member of the defence committee of the detainees in the conspiracy case, appeared before the investigative judge on 1 June under charges of “offending others through telecommunications networks “according to Article 86 of the telecommunications code and “accusing a public official of illegal acts without proof” for his intervention during a press conference of the defence committee on 15 May 2023 in which he said that there were discrepancies in the case file noticed by the lawyers which indicated evidence of tampering with the case. “The very essence of justice is undermined when legal professionals are deterred from fulfilling their duties by fear of reprisals or punished merely for advocating their clients’ rights. Authorities must not act in reprisal against lawyers for exercising their legitimate duties and their right to freedom of expression,” said Heba Morayef. Background. Since February 2023, Tunisian authorities have opened criminal investigations against at least 40 people on unfounded accusations in relation to trumped up charges of conspiracy that Amnesty International has deemed to be unfounded. The investigations fall under 10 provisions of the Tunisian Penal Code including Article 72, which mandates the death penalty for trying to “change the nature of the state.” They also face several charges under a dozen articles of the 2015 counterterrorism law including Article 32, which mandates up to 20 years of imprisonment for “forming a terrorist organization”. Between 12 and 23 February eight members of the opposition were arrested and detained under this investigation. Amongst them were opposition political activist and leader in the opposition political group Salvation Front Chaima Issa and lawyer and political activist Lazhar Akermi. After nearly five months of detention, Chaima Issa and Lazhar Akermi were provisionally released on 13 July 2023. However, at least six of their co-defendants remain in prolonged pre-trial arbitrary detention in relation to this investigation. They are politician Khayam Turki; dissident and politician Abdelhamid Jelassi; opposition activist Issam Chebbi; opposition activist Jaouhar Ben Mbarek; and finally, lawyers and opposition activists Ghazi Chaouachi and Ridha Belhaj.",9367,tunisian authority immediately unconditionally release political opposition figure arbitrarily detain nearly month solely peaceful political activism unfounded accusation conspiracy state security drop charge face similar charge say amnesty international detainee include opposition activist jaouhar ben mbarek politician khayam turki dissident politician abdelhamid jlassi opposition activist issam chebbi lawyer ghazi chaouachi ridha bel hadj hold initial pre trial detention order month renew investigative judge expire august week ben mbarek announce hunger strike denounce arbitrary detention prominent human right lawyer ayachi hammami investigate case similar accusation detain client summon attend interrogation investigative judge morning october signal authority renew effort pursue case tunisian authority carry political witch hunt round opposition figure misuse judicial system suppress right freedom expression crackdown political dissent seven month throw opposition politician dissident activist prolong pre trial detention reserve exceptional case wield weapon peaceful activist continue arbitrary detention political detainee travesty stop say heba morayef amnesty international director middle east north africa october tunisian authority bring criminal charge detainee lawyer separate legal case grow crackdown judicial harassment lawyer catch case deeply disturbing feature past month instead open new investigation lawyer people arbitrarily detain tunisian authority immediately unconditionally release defendant immediately drop unfounded charge accusation politically motivated case end authority impunity shameful campaign repression say heba morayef hammami interrogation follow mohamed hamdi ahmed nejib chebbi riadh chaibi noureddine bhiri opposition political activist investigate case indicate judge investigate defendant allow decide indictment defense lawyer appeal pre trial detention order file multiple request provisional release investigative judge repeatedly refuse request prosecution opposition leader lawyer october tunis court instance general prosecutor refer lawyers islem hamza dalila ben mbarek msaddak investigation statement medium september respectively radio interview hamza say charge client fabricate aim investigation silence political opposition radio interview msaddak explain lawyer request subpoena testimony foreign diplomat detainee accuse having exchange intelligence investigate connection charge decree law law protection personal data risk heavy prison sentence convict defence team detainee compose seven lawyer target criminal investigation relation peaceful expression case islem hamza refer investigation decree law june relation media statement capacity defence lawyer criticize transportation condition detainee prison lawyer member defence committee detainee conspiracy case appear investigative judge june charge offend telecommunications network accord article telecommunications code accuse public official illegal act proof intervention press conference defence committee say discrepancy case file notice lawyer indicate evidence tamper case essence justice undermine legal professional deter fulfil duty fear reprisal punish merely advocate client right authority act reprisal lawyer exercise legitimate duty right freedom expression say heba morayef background february tunisian authority open criminal investigation people unfounded accusation relation trump charge conspiracy amnesty international deem unfounded investigation fall provision tunisian penal code include article mandate death penalty try change nature state face charge dozen article counterterrorism law include article mandate year imprisonment form terrorist organization february member opposition arrest detain investigation opposition political activist leader opposition political group salvation chaima issa lawyer political activist lazhar akermi nearly month detention chaima issa lazhar akermi provisionally release july co defendant remain prolong pre trial arbitrary detention relation investigation politician khayam turki dissident politician abdelhamid jelassi opposition activist issam chebbi opposition activist jaouhar ben mbarek finally lawyer opposition activist ghazi chaouachi ridha belhaj
423287205,"Between 5 and 9 September, immigration detainees in Poland’s Przemysl detention centre (Guarded Centre for Aliens) held a hunger strike against “arbitrary detention” and their prolonged detention in the centre. Taking place against a backdrop of growing anti-migrant rhetoric in the run up to the country’s October elections and referendum, this was the largest collective hunger strike to-date. According to Grupa Granica , an organisation which assists migrants in Poland, up to 70 people participated in the strike at the centre, which has a detainee population of 100. Amongst their demands , strikers called for access to healthcare, ability to connect with friends and family through social media, and a guarantee that detainees’ rights will be respected. In particular, they called for an end to lengthy detention periods. As one detainee explained to Balkan Insight , detainees in the centre have no idea when they will leave the centre. “Even criminals in prisons know when they will be released,” he said. The strike reportedly ended soon after masked men stormed into cells within the centre on 8 September, and beat detainees with sticks. Since 2021, the numbers of migrants and asylum seekers entering Poland has increased, largely due to significant numbers of arrivals entering from Belarus. Many are pushed back into Belarus, while most of those who successfully reach Poland are arrested and detained. According to the Polish Border Guard , by the end of August some 19,000 people had attempted to enter Poland from Belarus this year, compared to 16,000 throughout 2022. According to Grupa Granica, 1,008 foreigners were placed in immigration detention during the first half of 2023. The country’s ruling party, the Law and Justice Party (PiS), has responded with discriminatory and belligerent language focused on the “defence” of the eastern border from “illegal migrants.” In an attempt to legitimise these policies, on 15 October PiS will hold a referendum (on the same day as the national elections) which includes questions regarding the country’s migrant and refugee policy. Two of the referendum’s four    are: “Do you support the removal of the barrier on the border between the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Belarus?” “Do you support the admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, in accordance with the forced relocation mechanism imposed by European bureaucracy?” The referendum has been extensively criticised by rights groups. According to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights , the explanatory annex contains deliberately leading information, which “directly suggests the ‘correct’ way to vote. Information spots contain false, simplified information, use rhetorical and emotional manipulations and intentionally create a sense of threat in the recipient.” The group adds: “Human rights, including the rights of migrants and refugees, are fundamental and inalienable rights of every individual, and their protection should not be left to a politically motivated, populist referendum.”",9367,september immigration detainee poland przemysl detention centre guarded centre aliens hold hunger strike arbitrary detention prolong detention centre take place backdrop grow anti migrant rhetoric run country october election referendum large collective hunger strike date accord grupa granica organisation assist migrant poland people participate strike centre detainee population demand striker call access healthcare ability connect friend family social medium guarantee detainee right respect particular call end lengthy detention period detainee explain balkan insight detainee centre idea leave centre criminal prison know release say strike reportedly end soon mask man storm cell centre september beat detainee stick number migrant asylum seeker enter poland increase largely significant number arrival enter belarus push belarus successfully reach poland arrest detain accord polish border guard end august people attempt enter poland belarus year compare accord grupa granica foreigner place immigration detention half country rule party law justice party pi respond discriminatory belligerent language focus defence eastern border illegal migrant attempt legitimise policy october pi hold referendum day national election include question country migrant refugee policy referendum support removal barrier border republic poland republic belarus support admission thousand illegal immigrant middle east africa accordance force relocation mechanism impose european bureaucracy referendum extensively criticise right group accord helsinki foundation human rights explanatory annex contain deliberately lead information directly suggest correct way vote information spot contain false simplified information use rhetorical emotional manipulation intentionally create sense threat recipient group add human right include right migrant refugee fundamental inalienable right individual protection leave politically motivate populist referendum
423287412,"Ahead of a hearing at the General Court of the European Union, in which Frontex, the EU border agency, will be questioned over its lack of transparency in relation to its involvement in maritime interceptions and subsequent human rights abuses against refugees and migrants in Libya, Matteo de Bellis, Amnesty International’s Refugee Rights Researcher, said: “Frontex uses planes and drones to spot any people trying to reach safety in Europe by crossing the Mediterranean, before then alerting the Libyan coastguards. As a results, refugees and migrants are routinely intercepted by Libyan coastguards and returned to Libya, where they face arbitrary detention and torture on a mass scale.”    Matteo de Bellis. “Frontex must be transparent about its role in any operations that may have led to human rights violations against refugees and migrants. Without such transparency, any pledges the agency makes regarding human rights protections will be tokenistic and will not lead to the positive changes that the agency promises.” Amnesty International will attend the hearing in Luxembourg to observe proceedings and support efforts to advance justice for refugees and migrants in the central Mediterranean. Background. On 11 October 2023, at 14:30 CEST, the General Court of the European Union will hold a hearing on the case Naass and Sea-Watch v Frontex . The case focuses on Frontex’s refusal to disclose documents relating to its surveillance activities in the central Mediterranean on 30 July 2021, when the Libyan Coast Guard intercepted about 20 people in the Maltese Search-and-Rescue Region and returned them to Libya. Sea-Watch, which was operating Seabird 1, an aircraft, and Sea-Watch 3, a rescue vessel, witnessed the operation and subsequently investigated the incident, together with other organizations. Sea-Watch, assisted by the NGO FragDenStaat, asked Frontex to disclose documents detailing its aerial operations and its cooperation with Italian, Maltese and Libyan authorities.

423288482,"To Permanent Representatives of Member and Observer States of the United Nations. Re: Joint Call to Advance Gender Justice in the Draft Crimes Against Humanity Convention. Dear Excellencies, We, the undersigned individuals and organizations, are writing regarding the currently under your consideration. We applaud the Sixth Committee’s leadership on and engagement with the draft articles. April’s resumed session discussion was an indisputable advance. Progress is being made to form the basis for actual negotiations of a new crimes against humanity convention that would have significant potential to advance protection for civilian populations at risk as well as justice for gender-based crimes. The current draft draws its definitional language from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The statute was an important step forward in the codification of atrocity crimes, including its explicit recognition of a range of sexual and gender-based crimes beyond rape. However, in the 25 years since the Rome Statute’s adoption, there has been significant progress in our understanding of sexual and gender-based crimes and notions of gender, and a new international treaty on crimes against humanity must reflect that progress. Indeed, the ILC itself noted that its objective in drafting the articles was not “codification of existing law,” but rather, to draft “provisions that would be both effective and likely acceptable to States, based on provisions often used in widely adhered-to treaties addressing crimes, as a basis for a possible future convention.” In that vein, we support the ILC’s decision to exclude the Rome Statute’s definition of ‘gender’ from the draft articles in recognition of “developments in international human rights law and international criminal law” that reflect “the current understanding as to the meaning of the term ‘gender.’” As States consider the draft articles, we urge you to approach the development of a new crimes against humanity treaty with a gender-competent, survivor-centric, and intersectional lens. Such an approach would involve ensuring the inclusion of a non-discrimination provision anchoring the obligation to apply and interpret the treaty’s provisions consistent with internationally recognized human rights law and without adverse distinction on grounds including race, gender, age, disability, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status. Relatedly, any wording which results in the exclusion or minimization of legal protection should be avoided. In particular, as you consider your own substantive positions on the treaty, including for submission of written comments by December 1, 2023, and in advance of the Sixth Committee’s second resumed session in April 2024, we urge you to consider issues relating to strengthening the gender-progressive, survivor-centric, and intersectional nature of the draft articles, which may include: Improving the reproductive violence provisions by revising the definition of sexual violence to include reproductive violence, eliminating the unnecessary sentence in the definition of forced pregnancy that references national abortion laws, and using gender-inclusive language in the definition of forced pregnancy; Including the slave trade as an enumerated provision; Codifying gender apartheid as an international crime by adding gender as a basis for the crime against humanity of apartheid, in direct response to from women’s civil society; Including forced marriage as a specifically enumerated crime against humanity and adopting a clear definition rooted in the significant international case law to date, to reflect the development of international criminal law on this offense; and; Ensuring provisions on victim/survivor participation and rights are robust, including a broad and unambiguous definition of ‘victim’ and expanding reparations provisions, and reflect input from affected communities. Each of these points have been developed further by groups of international legal subject-matter experts, for your benefit and consideration. Links to those briefs are included in the footnotes to the relevant topic, other than the victim/survivor brief, which is in a consultation process with victim/survivor groups and remains forthcoming. Please note that each brief reflects the views of the authors and signatories only of that brief. A strong, gender-progressive crimes against humanity convention would also provide for a treaty body monitoring mechanism to promote implementation of the treaty, advance progressive interpretations of the text, and monitor progress on gender justice under the treaty. States could draw from the monitoring bodies established under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, treaties which are similarly geared toward preventing and punishing specific conduct. While there are numerous opportunities for States to press for more gender-progressive provisions in the text of the draft articles, it is equally essential that the treaty-making process itself is inclusive. States must ensure robust participation by women and gender minorities in the delegations in all stages of the treaty- development process, including drafting, design, negotiation, implementation, and monitoring of the convention. It is equally important that survivors of crimes against humanity are part of the treaty-making process, partaking in decisions that impact them, and ensuring that survivors’ voices are adequately represented in the final provisions of the treaty. Given this unique and powerful opportunity to combat impunity and codify progressive standards of international law, we urge States to adopt a gender-competent, survivor-centric, and intersectional lens and reflect the progress made and lessons learned in the 25 years since the Rome Statute was adopted.

All times are local (unless otherwise noted) Masaya is a broad, 6 x 11 km caldera with steep-sided walls up to 300 m high located about 20 km SE of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. Eruptions have originated from the Nindirí and Masaya cones, which were constructed at the southern end of the fracture system and contain multiple summit craters, including the currently active Santiago crater. The Santiago crater contains a small lava lake that emits weak gas-and-steam plumes. The current eruption period began in October 2015 and more recently has consisted of weak thermal activity and gas-and-steam emissions (BGVN 47:08). This report updates activity from August 2022 through January 2023, characterized by continued thermal activity, seismicity, and sulfur dioxide emissions, based on Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) monthly reports and satellite data. Thermal activity has been relatively consistent over the past two years, according to the MIROVA (Middle InfraRed Observation of Volcanic Activity) graph (figure 107). An analysis of MODIS satellite data showed 15 low-power thermal hotspots during the reporting period: twice in mid-August 2022, twice in early November 2022, five times in December 2022, and six times in January 2023.

423291623,"WMO hosted an international workshop on the development of a comprehensive integrated global observing system that would support the implementation of the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch (GGGW). The Global Greenhouse Gas Watch was approved by the World Meteorological Congress in May 2023 in view of the increasing urgency of climate change mitigation. It aims to fill critical information gaps and provide an integrated, operational framework which brings under one roof all space-based and surface-based observing systems, as well as modelling and data assimilation capabilities. Most of the existing international and national activities are currently undertaken by the research community and supported by research funding. At present, there is no comprehensive, routine and timely international exchange of surface and space-based greenhouse gas observations or modelling products. The three-day workshop “Observations within the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch,” brought together more than 200 experts from the public and private sectors and academia on 3-5 October. “Many of the participants highlighted WMO’s long-standing World Weather Watch as a model to follow, and the participants were particularly interested in the opportunity to significantly strengthen the greenhouse gas observing networks both on land and over the ocean through international coordination,” said Lars Peter Riishojgaard, Deputy Director of WMO Infrastructure Department. “The engagement of so many internationally recognized scientists as well as some of the world’s premier global greenhouse gas flux estimation capabilities in the planning of the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch is extremely encouraging. The community clearly recognizes the role of strengthened international collaboration and coordination in enabling it to provide a stronger and more clearly articulated message to the UNFCCC Parties and other stakeholders,” he said. The workshop on 3-5 October on “Observations within the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch” issued recommendations regarding the design of the integrated observing system, gap analysis of the existing capabilities and recommendations on the ways to leverage those, and prioritization of the actions for implementation. Topics addressed included: Taking stock of the existing observing systems for atmospheric, ocean and biosphere measurements of greenhouse gases and their fluxes from ground/earth surface and space, Integration of observations from different platforms within each domain and across Earth System domains, Common approaches to Quality Assurance and Quality control including calibration and uncertainty characterization, Metadata standards, International data exchange, Needs for capacity development in observations, Sustainability of the observing system. The Global Greenhouse Gas Watch builds on WMO’s experience in coordinating international collaboration in weather prediction and climate analysis and on long-standing activities in greenhouse gas monitoring and research under the auspices of the Global Atmosphere Watch established in 1989 and its Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System. A series of stakeholder meetings have taken place as momentum builds. The EU-funded Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), implemented by ECMWF, hosted a meeting last month to bring different organisations involved in monitoring greenhouse gases together and to develop common standards for exchanging data and comparing products. Thus, data from different organisations, such as ECMWF/CAMS, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Chinese Meteorological Administration will have to be made comparable. “CAMS is an active player in this field as it monitors and forecasts global levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations as well as net fluxes of those gases into the atmosphere,” says the Director of CAMS, Vincent-Henri Peuch. “So we’ll have a role to play in the WMO initiative.”",9367,wmo host international workshop development comprehensive integrate global observe system support implementation global greenhouse gas watch gggw global greenhouse gas watch approve world meteorological congress view increase urgency climate change mitigation aim fill critical information gap provide integrate operational framework bring roof space base surface base observe system modelling datum assimilation capability exist international national activity currently undertake research community support research funding present comprehensive routine timely international exchange surface space base greenhouse gas observation modelling product day workshop observation global greenhouse gas watch bring expert public private sector academia october participant highlight wmo long stand world weather watch model follow participant particularly interested opportunity significantly strengthen greenhouse gas observe network land ocean international coordination say lars peter riishojgaard deputy director wmo infrastructure department engagement internationally recognize scientist world premier global greenhouse gas flux estimation capability planning global greenhouse gas watch extremely encouraging community clearly recognize role strengthen international collaboration coordination enable provide strong clearly articulate message unfccc parties stakeholder say workshop october observation global greenhouse gas watch issue recommendation design integrate observe system gap analysis exist capability recommendation way leverage prioritization action implementation topic address include take stock exist observe system atmospheric ocean biosphere measurement greenhouse gas flux ground earth surface space integration observation different platform domain earth system domain common approach quality assurance quality control include calibration uncertainty characterization metadata standard international datum exchange need capacity development observation sustainability observe system global greenhouse gas watch build wmo experience coordinate international collaboration weather prediction climate analysis long stand activity greenhouse gas monitoring research auspex global atmosphere watch establish integrated global greenhouse gas information system series stakeholder meeting take place momentum build eu fund copernicus atmosphere monitoring service cams implement ecmwf host meeting month bring different organisation involve monitor greenhouse gas develop common standard exchange datum compare product datum different organisation ecmwf cams national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa nasa japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa chinese meteorological administration comparable cams active player field monitor forecast global level carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide concentration net flux gas atmosphere say director cams vincent henri peuch role play wmo initiative
423292147,"What happened, where and when? Bolivia is currently facing a severe crisis due to a combination of intense winter heat fueled by the climate crisis and the El Niño phenomenon. Large portions of the country are experiencing drought, water shortages, and rising average temperatures. Local authorities have issued stark warnings, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation during what has turned out to be the hottest winter ever recorded in the country. Temperatures have skyrocketed to a scorching 40C. Notably, on 25 September, Bolivia recorded its highest-ever September temperature, reaching 40.3C. In the weeks ahead, some regions are expected to experience even more extreme temperatures, potentially reaching as high as 45C. By December, there is a “high probability” Bolivia’s iconic Lake Titicaca will be 64cm below the drought alert level, breaking a low water record set in 1998 by 33cm (1). The Bolivian Drought Monitor reveals that all of the country's Macroregions, which are spatial monitoring units with similar climatic characteristics, are witnessing areas affected by drought. However, as indicated in Map 2, the Macroregions Altiplano (3,200 to 5,000 masl), Valles (1,500 to 3,000 masl), Yungas-Chapare (150 to 4,200 masl), and Chaco (279 to 2,000 masl) are the most severely impacted, experiencing significant soil moisture loss and displaying areas of moderate to extreme drought (2). At the departmental level, the drought is most severely affecting seven out of Bolivia's nine departments: La Paz, Potosí, Cochabamba, Oruro, Chuquisaca, Tarija and Santa Cruz. In four of these departments - Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Oruro, and Potosí - the Departmental Emergency Operations Centers (COED) have recommended the declaration of a state of emergency. Consequently, on 29 September, the Departmental Autonomous Government of Oruro promulgated Departmental Decree No. 235, titled 'Declaration of Departmental Disaster due to Adverse Drought Event in Oruro Municipalities,' in response to the drought's impact on over 200 communities (3). Similarly, on 21 September, the Departmental Autonomous Government of Cochabamba, through Decree No. 5585, declared a Departmental State of Emergency due to the ongoing drought situation. They called upon Municipal Autonomous Governments, Indigenous Peasant Farmers of Cochabamba, and the general public to use water responsibly for both irrigation and human consumption. Additionally, they urged everyone to take preventive and preparatory measures in anticipation of potential adverse events, emergencies, or disasters resulting from the current conditions. Notably, the recorded rainfall in municipalities has been the lowest since 1950, measuring less than 200 millimeters (4). On 14 September, the Autonomous Departmental Government of Chuquisaca declared a Departmental Emergency due to Meteorological (Frost) and Climatological (Drought) Threats via Departmental Decree No. 034. At the time of this departmental decree, 14 municipalities had already declared a State of Municipal Emergency, affecting over 68,690 families in the department (5).

423292359,"Section 2 TROPICAL CYCLONE OVERVIEW FOR 2022. 2.1 Review of tropical cyclones in 2022. **2.1.1 Tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific (including the South China Sea) ** In 2022, a total of 27 tropical cyclones occurred over the western North Pacific (WNP) and the South China Sea (SCS) bounded by the Equator, 45N, 100E and 180, less than the long-term (1961 - 2020) average figure of around 30. During the year, 11 of the tropical cyclones attained typhoon intensity or above, less than the long-term average (1961 - 2020) of about 15, with four of them reaching super typhoon intensity (maximum 10-minute wind speed of 185 km/h or above near the centre). Figure 2.1 shows the monthly frequencies of the occurrence of tropical cyclones in WNP and SCS in 2022. During the year, six tropical cyclones made landfall over China, with two of them crossing the south China coast within 300 km of Hong Kong. Three traversed the Philippines and three made landfall over Vietnam. With an estimated maximum sustained wind speed of 230 km/h and a minimum sea-level pressure of 910 hPa near the centre (Table 4.1), Super Typhoon Hinnamnor (2211) in August to September (Figure 2.3) was the most intense tropical cyclone over the WNP and the SCS in 2022. 2.1.2 Tropical cyclones in Hong Kong’s area of responsibility. Amongst the 27 tropical cyclones in 2022, 13 of them occurred inside Hong Kong’s area of responsibility (i.e. the area bounded by 10N, 30N, 105E and 125E), slightly more than the longterm annual average (1961-2020) figure of around 16 (Table 2.1). Five of them developed within Hong Kong’s area of responsibility. Altogether, 318 tropical cyclone warnings to ships and vessels were issued by the Hong Kong Observatory this year (Table 4.2). 2.1.3 Tropical cyclones over the South China Sea. Nine tropical cyclones affected SCS bounded by 10N, 25N, 105E and 120E in 2022, less than the long-term annual average (1961-2020) of around 12. Four of them formed over the SCS. 2.1.4 Tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong. In 2022, the typhoon season in Hong Kong started on 29 June when Tropical Depression Chaba (2203) formed over the central part of the SCS, necessitating the issuance of the Standby Signal No. 1. The typhoon season ended with the cancellation of all tropical cyclone warning signals on 3 November when Tropical Depression Nalgae (2222) weakened and moved inland after making landfall over Zhuhai.Six tropical cyclones affected Hong Kong during 2022 (Figure 2.2), on par with the long-term (1961-2020) average of about six in a year (Table 2.2). They were Typhoon Chaba (2203) in June to July, Tropical Depression, Tropical Storm Mulan (2207) and Typhoon Ma-on (2209) in August, Typhoon Nesat (2220) in October, and Severe Tropical Storm Nalgae (2222) in October to November. The No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal was issued during the passage of Chaba, Ma-on and Nalgae on 1 July, 24 August and 2 November respectively, the highest tropical cyclone warning signal issued in 2022. The No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal issued during the passage of Chaba was the first time on the HKSAR Establishment Day. Nalgae was the third tropical cyclone necessitating the issuance of the No. 8 Signal in November since 1946. The No. 3 Strong Wind Signal was issued during the passage of Mulan and Nesat. The Tropical Depression necessitated the issuance of the Standby Signal No. 1 in Hong Kong. 2.1.5 Tropical cyclone rainfall. Tropical cyclone rainfall for Hong Kong (total rainfall recorded at the Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters from the time when a tropical cyclone comes within 600 km of Hong Kong to 72 hours after it has dissipated or moved more than 600 km away from Hong Kong) in 2022 was 697.4 mm (Table 4.8.1). This accounted for approximately 31.6% of the year’s total rainfall of 2205.4 mm and slightly less than the 1961-2020 long-term average of 704.2 mm.

423295094,"Soixante-dix-huitième session Point 73 c) de l’ordre du jour provisoire* Promotion et protection des droits humains : situations relatives aux droits humains et rapports des rapporteurs et représentants spéciaux. Situation des droits de l’homme en Afghanistan. Note du Secrétaire général. Le Secrétaire général a l’honneur de transmettre à l’Assemblée générale le rapport du Rapporteur spécial sur la situation des droits de l’homme en Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, en application de la résolution 51/20 du Conseil des droits de l’homme. Résumé. Le présent rapport, soumis par le Rapporteur spécial sur la situation des droits de l’homme en Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, s’inscrit dans le prolongement de son rapport précédent et traite des faits nouveaux survenus principalement de février à août 2023. I. Introduction. 1. Le présent rapport, soumis conformément à la résolution 51/20 du Conseil des droits de l’homme, donne un aperçu de l’évolution de la situation des droits humains en Afghanistan, principalement entre février et août 2023. Il s’appuie sur le rapport du Rapporteur spécial présenté à l’Assemblée générale à sa soixante-dix-septième session ( A/77/552 ), ainsi que sur ses rapports au Conseil des droits de l’homme. 2. À ce jour, le Rapporteur spécial a effectué trois missions en Afghanistan depuis qu’il a pris ses fonctions en mai 2022, dont une mission conjointe avec la Présidente du Groupe de travail sur la discrimination à l’égard des femmes et des filles en avril et mai 2023. 3. Au cours de ces missions, le Rapporteur spécial s’est rendu dans les provinces de Kaboul, de Mazar-e Charif, de Kandahar, de Bamyan et du Panjchir. Il a rencontré de nombreuses parties prenantes et a été reçu par des hauts fonctionnaires de facto, notamment les vice-premiers ministres par intérim, des ministres et des hauts fonctionnaires au niveau provincial. Le Rapporteur spécial remercie les autorités de facto pour leur coopération dans le cadre de son mandat, y compris pour leurs contributions écrites à ses communications et rapports. 4. Le Rapporteur spécial a également eu des interactions régulières avec un large éventail de parties prenantes à l’extérieur du pays, en participant à des manifestations en personne et en ligne. II. Contexte. 5. Depuis que les Taliban ont pris le pouvoir en août 2021, la situation des droits humains en Afghanistan n’a cessé de se détériorer. Si un large éventail de droits ont été restreints ou violés par les autorités de facto, le cas le plus frappant est la restriction extrême des droits des femmes et des filles. Les autorités de facto ont adopté de nombreux décrets et directives qui privent les femmes et les filles de leurs droits fondamentaux, notamment le droit à l’éducation, au travail, à la liberté de circulation et à la participation à la vie politique et publique. Elles ont notamment interdit aux femmes afghanes de travailler pour des organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) en décembre 2022 et pour l’ONU en avril 2023, ce qui pèse sur les opérations humanitaires dans tout le pays. D’autres droits et libertés fondamentaux, notamment la liberté d’expression, d’opinion et de réunion, les droits à la vie, à l’intégrité physique et à l’accès à la justice, et les droits des minorités sont systématiquement violés, portant préjudice à l’ensemble de la population. L’espace civique continue de se rétrécir et les militantes et militants de la société civile, les journalistes et les manifestantes et manifestants pacifiques continuent de faire l’objet d’arrestations et de détentions arbitraires et de mauvais traitements. Le 13 novembre 2022, les autorités de facto ont annoncé le rétablissement des peines de qisas (loi du talion) et de houdoud (crimes contre Dieu), ce qui signifie que la peine de mort en public est de nouveau en vigueur, ainsi que d’autres peines inhumaines et dégradantes. Selon la Mission d’assistance des Nations Unies en Afghanistan (MANUA), un nombre important de personnes ont été soumis à la flagellation publique, dont 74 hommes, 58 femmes et 2 garçons entre novembre 2022 et avril 2023. 6. Les Taliban affirment non seulement que leurs politiques sont nécessaires pour se conformer à la charia, mais aussi qu’elles sont populaires auprès des Afghans vivant dans le pays. Cette affirmation est vigoureusement réfutée par d’autres Afghans qui résistent au pouvoir des Taliban. La négation constante des droits des femmes nuit sans aucun doute à la popularité des Taliban au niveau local. Elle crée également des obstacles majeurs à toute démarche de reconnaissance par la communauté internationale. 7. Les autorités de facto n’ont pas mis en place une équipe dirigeante qui inclue les femmes et tous les groupes ethniques et religieux. Le gouvernement de facto reste entièrement composé d’hommes, principalement du groupe ethnique des Pachtounes. Le chef des Taliban, Haibatullah Akhundzada, semble resserrer son emprise dire cte sur les affaires de l’État, notamment sur les secteurs de la sécurité et du renseignement, et le remaniement des administrations de la justice, de la sécurité et de la fonction publique, en particulier au niveau infranational, est devenu plus fréquent. Il a également déplacé le bureau du porte-parole des autorités de facto de Kaboul à Kandahar et créé des conseils religieux dotés d’un pouvoir de décision dans plus de 20 provinces. 8. On estime que 85 % des Afghanes et Afghans vivent en dessous du seuil de pauvreté et la fourniture de l’aide humanitaire est mise à rude épreuve. Alors que plus de la moitié de l’année s’est écoulée, le Plan de réponse humanitaire pour l’Afghanistan pour 2023 reste gravement sous-financé, avec seulement 744 millions de dollars reçus au 31 juillet, soit moins de la moitié du montant (1,49 milliard de dollars) reçu à la même époque en 2022.

423306518,"Attachments This Gender Alert has been developed by the regional Gender in Humanitarian Action (GiHA) Working Group in Western Region together with the National GIHA WG and the Women Advisory Group (WAG) to the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Afghanistan. The Gender Alert is based on updates, information and reports received from women organizations and humanitarian actors engaging with women in the Herat province, Western Region of Afghanistan. On 7 October 2023, a magnitude-6.3 earthquake rocked Herat province, in Western Afghanistan, followed by three aftershocks of magnitude 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5, and other smaller shocks. Most casualties and damages were located in four villages in the Zenda Jan district. As of 8 October, 2,000 were estimated to have died, over 9,000 were injured and 1,300 houses, representing almost 100% of all houses, were completely destroyed'. This alert aims to provide insights on the immediate and medium term needs of women and girls affected by the earthquake. Findings: situation of women and immediate needs Protection concerns for women and girls are on the rise: 63% of KIl participants in an IRC assessment who reported that their community members have access to latrine said that those latrines were not safe for women and girls to use”. 100% and 96% of KII respondents mentioned that girls and women respectively were more at risk. Women first responders and health workers in Herat regional hospital highlighted that soap, underwear, menstrual hygiene products are lacking, while food items were deemed available in sufficient quantities. Preliminary reports evidenced that affected communities required immediate psychosocial support, to complement other health interventions. Women health workers reported that the recurring aftershocks trigger strong reactions from patients, evidencing high-level of trauma. The earthquake is likely to worsen the mental health crisis that Afghan women are experiencing. 89% of women from the Western Region had already shared that their mental health had gotten worse in the period April to July 2023. Initial reports from women also highlighted that many casualties were caused by the most powerful aftershocks, and populations’ lack of earthquake safety and preparedness. Women may be more at risk of not obtaining information on earthquake preparedness, due to restrictions imposed on their rights and mobilities, as well as restrictions imposed on women humanitarian workers. Following the destruction of entire villages by the earthquake, initial reports mention that women-headed households, unaccompanied minors and unaccompanied elderly, were being relocated to a camp located in Herat City. Women headed households in particular may experience this relocation differently as they may not have a man who can access services on their behalf, and may no longer be able to rely on informal networks to receive information and assistance.",9367,attachment gender alert develop regional gender humanitarian action giha working group western region national giha wg women advisory group wag humanitarian country team hct afghanistan gender alert base update information report receive woman organization humanitarian actor engage woman herat province western region afghanistan october earthquake rock herat province western afghanistan follow aftershock magnitude small shock casualty damage locate village zenda jan district october estimate die injure house represent house completely destroy alert aim provide insight immediate medium term need woman girl affect earthquake finding situation woman immediate need protection concern woman girl rise kil participant irc assessment report community member access latrine say latrine safe woman girl use kii respondent mention girl woman respectively risk woman responder health worker herat regional hospital highlight soap underwear menstrual hygiene product lack food item deem available sufficient quantity preliminary report evidence affect community require immediate psychosocial support complement health intervention woman health worker report recur aftershock trigger strong reaction patient evidence high level trauma earthquake likely worsen mental health crisis afghan woman experience woman western region share mental health get bad period april july initial report woman highlight casualty cause powerful aftershock population lack earthquake safety preparedness woman risk obtain information earthquake preparedness restriction impose right mobility restriction impose woman humanitarian worker follow destruction entire village earthquake initial report mention woman head household unaccompanied minor unaccompanied elderly relocate camp locate herat city woman head household particular experience relocation differently man access service behalf long able rely informal network receive information assistance
423308138,"The widespread deployment of mines and cluster munitions in Ukraine has made it the most heavily mined country in the world today. Norway will more than double its support to efforts to clear mines laid in Ukraine since the start of Russia’s brutal war of aggression. ‘Clearing mines saves lives and protects civilians, especially children. Mine clearance is also essential to be able to provide other types of emergency assistance and rebuild infrastructure. Preventing further loss of life also helps to strengthen Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russia’s aggression,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt. The Norwegian Government has therefore decided to provide an additional NOK 200 million in funding earmarked for clearance of mines and other explosives in Ukraine. Clearance of mines and other explosives is a key priority area both for the Ukrainians themselves and for Norwegian efforts in Ukraine. Ukraine’s own post-war recovery plan identifies humanitarian mine clearance as one of the top five priorities. The Ukrainian authorities will place particular focus on restoration of agricultural land and reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Approximately 30 % of Ukraine’s land area is now littered with mines and unexploded ordnance. Demining is vital to enable Ukrainian farmers to cultivate their crops. Prior to Russia’s invasion, Ukraine was known as the breadbasket of the world. Now, hundreds of millions of people in vulnerable areas outside Ukraine are at risk of starvation due to the decline in Ukrainian grain production and attacks by Russia on Ukrainian ports and grain exports. ‘Russia’s military aggression on Ukrainian territory is affecting more than just Ukraine. It is threatening food security across the entire world,’ said Ms Huitfeldt. Norway has provided NOK 164 million for mine clearance activities since Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022. The Norwegian Government has now decided to increase its funding for humanitarian mine clearance activities significantly. The funds will be channelled through established mine clearance organisations including Norwegian People’s Aid, the HALO Trust and the UN system. The funds are being allocated under the Nansen Support Programme for Ukraine. Norway has provided support for mine clearance activities in Ukraine since 2015 and has extensive experience with mine clearance in the area. Norway has now provided more than NOK 4.5 billion in humanitarian support to Ukraine and the refugee response in neighbouring countries. State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Eivind Vad Petersson will be taking part in the International Donor Conference on Humanitarian Demining in Ukraine to be held in Zagreb on 11 October. The conference will bring together the major donors to mine clearance efforts in Ukraine. The new NOK 200 million allocation from Norway will be announced at the conference.",9367,widespread deployment mine cluster munition ukraine heavily mine country world today norway double support effort clear mine lay ukraine start russia brutal war aggression clearing mine save life protect civilian especially child clearance essential able provide type emergency assistance rebuild infrastructure prevent loss life help strengthen ukraine ability withstand russia aggression say minister foreign affairs anniken huitfeldt norwegian government decide provide additional nok million funding earmark clearance mine explosive ukraine clearance mine explosive key priority area ukrainians norwegian effort ukraine ukraine post war recovery plan identify humanitarian clearance priority ukrainian authority place particular focus restoration agricultural land reconstruction critical infrastructure approximately ukraine land area litter mine unexploded ordnance demining vital enable ukrainian farmer cultivate crop prior russia invasion ukraine know breadbasket world hundred million people vulnerable area outside ukraine risk starvation decline ukrainian grain production attack russia ukrainian port grain export russia military aggression ukrainian territory affect ukraine threaten food security entire world say ms huitfeldt norway provide nok million clearance activity russia launch scale war ukraine february norwegian government decide increase funding humanitarian clearance activity significantly fund channel establish clearance organisation include norwegian people aid halo trust un system fund allocate nansen support programme ukraine norway provide support clearance activity ukraine extensive experience clearance area norway provide nok billion humanitarian support ukraine refugee response neighbouring country state secretary ministry foreign affairs eivind vad petersson take international donor conference humanitarian demining ukraine hold zagreb october conference bring major donor clearance effort ukraine new nok million allocation norway announce conference
423309098,"The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the United Nations-Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) held simulation exercises for the Building on Social Protection for Anticipatory Action and Response in Emergencies and Disasters (B-SPARED) Project in two pilot areas in Mindanao. The B-SPARED Project is an Anticipatory Action (AA) pilot initiative that aims to implement various protective measures before the onset of disasters to mitigate risks and shocks, as well as to help break the cycle of poverty among vulnerable groups due to recurring natural hazards. The first simulation exercise was conducted in selected barangays in Bacuag, Surigao del Norte on September 28 and 29, according to Maria Arlyn Gerez, chief of the Disaster Preparedness and Response Division (DPRD) which is under the Disaster Response Management Bureau of the DSWD. “The simulation exercise highlighted typhoon interventions which included emergency cash pay-outs and early evacuation of boats,” Gerez said. On October 7, flood interventions including cash pay-outs and distribution of tight-lid drums for storage of agricultural products were also simulated in Cotabato and select barangays in the municipality of Midsayap. Gerez said the series of simulation exercises is a good opportunity for key actors to test the effectiveness of B-SPARED, particularly government systems and processes that support its implementation. “These include the utilization of the National Household Targeting System (NHTS) for the selection of beneficiaries as part of strengthening our social protection systems in place,” Gerez pointed out. Gerez explained that the exercise also serves to “strengthen the collaboration between and among our various partners involving the UN-FAO, provincial and municipal local government partners, the private sector and local communities to protect and build the resiliency of the poor and vulnerable in times of emergencies and disasters.” FAO Social Policy and Programme Coordinator Ruth Honculada-Georget said the exercises provided important lessons and challenges that inform the evolving work in AA with government’s social protection programs and systems. “The key insights we have gained are critical as we work with the DSWD and our partners in harnessing programs such as the 4Ps conditional cash transfer program and the national poverty registry (Listahanan 3). We are proud to partner with the DSWD and local government units which are leading the way in addressing food insecurity and preventing the disruption of livelihoods before a disaster strikes, especially among the poorest households,” Honculada-Georget said. The collaboration is based on the Cooperation Agreement between the DSWD and the UN-FAO in 2021 to operationalize an integrated approach using disaster risk reduction protocols, and social protection systems to scale up a humanitarian response. The simulation exercises were conducted with the support of the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (EU-CPHAO). Anticipatory Action or AA is an innovative humanitarian approach that systematically links early warnings to a set of interventions aimed at protecting at-risk families and their assets ahead of a hazard, using science-based forecasts and risk analysis. #",9367,department social welfare development dswd united nations food agriculture organization un fao hold simulation exercise building social protection anticipatory action response emergencies disasters b spared project pilot area mindanao b spared project anticipatory action aa pilot initiative aim implement protective measure onset disaster mitigate risk shock help break cycle poverty vulnerable group recur natural hazard simulation exercise conduct select barangay bacuag surigao del norte september accord maria arlyn gerez chief disaster preparedness response division dprd disaster response management bureau dswd simulation exercise highlight typhoon intervention include emergency cash pay out early evacuation boat gerez say october flood intervention include cash pay out distribution tight lid drum storage agricultural product simulate cotabato select barangay municipality midsayap gerez say series simulation exercise good opportunity key actor test effectiveness b spared particularly government system process support implementation include utilization national household targeting system nhts selection beneficiary strengthen social protection system place gerez point gerez explain exercise serve strengthen collaboration partner involve un fao provincial municipal local government partner private sector local community protect build resiliency poor vulnerable time emergency disaster fao social policy programme coordinator ruth honculada georget say exercise provide important lesson challenge inform evolving work aa government social protection program system key insight gain critical work dswd partner harness program conditional cash transfer program national poverty registry listahanan proud partner dswd local government unit lead way address food insecurity prevent disruption livelihood disaster strike especially poor household honculada georget say collaboration base cooperation agreement dswd un fao operationalize integrate approach disaster risk reduction protocol social protection system scale humanitarian response simulation exercise conduct support european union civil protection humanitarian aid operations eu cphao anticipatory action aa innovative humanitarian approach systematically link early warning set intervention aim protect risk family asset ahead hazard science base forecast risk analysis

423310758,"This report is produced by OCHA Libya in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the period from 3 to 10 October 2023. The next report will be issued on or around 17 October. HIGHLIGHTS Four weeks into the crisis, the humanitarian response continues alongside early recovery and reconstruction efforts. Assistance is ongoing in the affected areas, with some delays in assessments and data collection caused by a communication outage in Benghazi. After the school year started with a delay in the east last week, Derna schools reopened for recreational activities and psychosocial support on 8 October. About 98 schools remain closed due to damage or other flood-related access issues in the affected areas, five of them in Derna. Eleven schools continue to host displaced people. Food prices stabilized on an increased level with some exceptions. Banking services have been restored, with limitations on withdrawal amounts and access to digital banking. The UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team that arrived in Libya on 13 September ended its mission on 7 October, after supporting the establishment of coordination structures and completing a multi-thematic needs assessment. 250K People in need. 146K People reached. 42K internally displaced. 4.3K Deaths. 8.5K Missing. 1.2K Cases of watery diarrhea. SITUATION OVERVIEW. IOM and partners assessed 38 collective centres for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and found that 14 are currently occupied by about 1,800 people. This is a significant decrease from the initial count of about 3,300 people hosted in 37 sites. An ongoing communication outage and security concerns in and around Benghazi delayed further data collection in Benghazi. A total of 34 schools in affected areas were repurposed to host IDPs in the first days after the floods. As of 10 October, 11 remain collective IDP centres; 23 have been vacated and reopened for education. In Benghazi, collective centres hosting families from Derna were reportedly closed. There are unconfirmed reports that families have been offered a rental subsidy. IDPs originally from Tawergha and secondarily displaced after the floods still live in school buildings and have not been offered rental assistance. IDPs in Albayda schools were moved to two hotels. In Derna, most IDPs in schools have reportedly been registered and promised cash-for-rent assistance. One school in Derna still hosts IDPs. The local Derna Relief Committee has to date registered 4,000 displaced households and estimates there are in total 5,000 displaced households (about 25,000 individuals) in Derna, compared to 16,000 IDPs in Derna recorded by IOM-DTM. Derna schools reopened on 8 October with a two-week mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and recreational programme. Resumption of formal education is planned for 28 October. Five damaged schools in Derna remain closed. UNHCR and partners are advocating for equal access to assistance for all affected people, including IDPs who were secondarily displaced, non-Libyans and other vulnerable groups. Displacement, death of family members, the destruction of houses, the loss of livelihood and trauma have resulted in new vulnerabilities, particularly for unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) and newly widowed women and their families. Reliable data on these affected groups is not available yet due to lack of registration and death certificates, as well as the high number (8,500) of people still missing. UNICEF and child protection partners are working with local authorities on rapid registration of children who have been separated from both parents. Key messages have been distributed to partners, authorities and communities and a child protection case management system is being put in place for family tracing, reunification and alternative care options. UASC are particularly vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, abuse, denial of access to basic services, trauma and the lack of identification papers. UNFPA estimates that up to 24,000 of the women and girls who need humanitarian assistance are pregnant and lacking essential sexual and reproductive health services. About one in ten of that number are expected to give birth in the next month. WHO is leading efforts to establish standards and a coordination mechanism to address affected people’s high demand for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS). According to WFP, banking services are accessible again for people in the affected areas, but the maximum cash withdrawal is limited to an average amount of 3,000 LYD (approximately US$610) per month. UN advocacy efforts are ongoing to request the registration of customers for digital methods of payments to ease transfers to and within Libya, increase the withdrawal ceiling for humanitarian agencies and ensure cash supply to flood-affected areas. WFP and IOM assessed market functionality in affected areas. Prices have mostly stabilized on an increased level, except for eggs. About 50 per cent of households continue to report issues with accessibility, affordability and availability of essential goods. Disruption in local markets and economic activities was reported by 8 per cent of households. Further market functionality analysis is underway, including a cash partner and REACH Initiative Joint Rapid Market Assessment (JRMA) to gain insights into the availability of non-food and minimum expenditure food items. Further related assessments are planned by FAO and UNDP, with focus on early recovery and the agricultural sector. The UNDAC team left Libya on 7 October. During its three-week deployment, UNDAC, including OCHA staff and operational partners from REACH, iMMAP, MapAction, Atlas Logistics, Télécoms Sans Frontières, and the EU supported humanitarian coordination, needs assessments and information management. UNDP conducted an analysis of satellite imagery and data for seven severely affected areas, including Derna, Benghazi, Almarj, Albayda, Shahhat, Sousa and Altamimi to evaluate damage to critical infrastructure and debris generation. UNDP's collaboration with the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) was valuable due to limited access in these areas. UNDP experts joined to support the debris removal, disposal and development of related guidelines.

423317785,"Trócaire's call for immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and lasting peace in Israel and Palestine. Trócaire is horrified by the recent escalation of violence across Israel and Palestine and condemns the indiscriminate attacks, hostage taking and killing of innocent civilians that have taken place during the Hamas incursion into Israel in recent days, acts that amount to war crimes. We are deeply concerned by Israel’s decision to block the entrance of food, fuel and electricity to the Gaza Strip. Imposing a total closure of the Strip amounts to collective punishment of an unprecedented scale, on an already vulnerable and impoverished population. Women and children will bear the brunt of these extreme actions. Furthermore, the indiscriminate bombing and the intentional attacks against the Palestinian civilian population and infrastructure such as hospitals and schools by the Israeli army also amount to war crimes. Trócaire calls on all parties involved in the conflict to immediately cease hostilities and all relevant stakeholders to ensure that critical humanitarian access and supports such as food, water and medical supplies are guaranteed. It is imperative that international law is respected by all parties and that civilians and humanitarian workers are protected from harm. Additionally, there needs to be full accountability for all violations of international law. The latest violence has resulted not only in the loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives but is exacerbating an already unbearable situation in the Gaza Strip where 80% of the population are dependent on humanitarian assistance and poverty levels are catastrophically high. Trócaire wants peace in Israel and Palestine. We want that peace to be based on mutual respect and understanding, with security, justice and equality for all. Decades of military occupation and 16 years of a blockade of the Gaza Strip, along with the systematic discrimination and oppression that Palestinians endure daily, have continued to erode the possibilities for this to be achieved and have deepened and entrenched poverty levels. There is an compelling need to address these root causes urgently and comprehensively, and it is incumbent on the international community to take immediate steps to this end. Trócaire will continue to monitor the situation closely and will stay in close contact with our local partners over the coming hours and days to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need.",9367,trócaire immediate ceasefire humanitarian aid last peace israel palestine trócaire horrify recent escalation violence israel palestine condemn indiscriminate attack hostage taking killing innocent civilian take place hamas incursion israel recent day act war crime deeply concern israel decision block entrance food fuel electricity gaza strip impose total closure strip amount collective punishment unprecedented scale vulnerable impoverished population woman child bear brunt extreme action furthermore indiscriminate bombing intentional attack palestinian civilian population infrastructure hospital school israeli army war crime trócaire call party involve conflict immediately cease hostility relevant stakeholder ensure critical humanitarian access support food water medical supply guarantee imperative international law respect party civilian humanitarian worker protect harm additionally need accountability violation international law late violence result loss innocent israeli palestinian life exacerbate unbearable situation gaza strip population dependent humanitarian assistance poverty level catastrophically high trócaire want peace israel palestine want peace base mutual respect understanding security justice equality decade military occupation year blockade gaza strip systematic discrimination oppression palestinians endure daily continue erode possibility achieve deepen entrenched poverty level compelling need address root cause urgently comprehensively incumbent international community immediate step end trócaire continue monitor situation closely stay close contact local partner come hour day support delivery humanitarian assistance need
423304861,"The number of Afghan refugees moving along the Balkan Route has remained very high this summer. A large proportion of those taking the long trip to central, western and northern Europe are in their early twenties and many are under-age. From Turkey, they usually cross Greece and Bulgaria in order to reach Serbia. Once there, most opt for the ‘Western Balkan route’ leading through Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia and finally Italy where routes for further possible destinations split once again. Among these countries, Croatia became, in January 2023, the European Union’s foremost external border facing the Balkan Route, while non-EU Serbia, remains a midway staging point for migrants, beyond the EU borders yet conveniently close to their final destinations. During a recent visit to Croatia and Serbia, and through long-term observation from the vantage point of Trieste, the Italian city close to Croatia and Slovenia to which one of the western branches of the Balkan Route leads, AAN’s Fabrizio Foschini has sought to understand what is happening to Afghans transiting through these two, very diverse, yet closely connected, countries. Almost ten years ago, a young Afghan told me the story of how he had been unwittingly tricked by Croatia’s membership of the EU. After an odyssey of several months across Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary he was one of those low-budget DIY travellers who, without even a GPS, counted only on their skills to make it to their destination he had managed to cross the Serbian-Croatian border undetected. Coming out of a plum tree orchard where he had spent the night, and still wet from having waded a creek to get there the previous evening, he walked into a Croatian hamlet and inquired from the first person he met his basic whereabouts: “Which country am I in? Is it in the European Union?” “Yes!” was the somewhat upbeat reply. “This is Croatia, we’re in the EU!” It took my friend, who had hurried to the nearest police station and duly applied for asylum, hoping his roaming was over, some days to understand that the people he had met were highly enthusiastic because Croatia had in fact just joined the EU a few days previously, in that fateful July of 2013. It took him some more time to realise that the country had no proper reception system yet and offered no viable chances to asylum seekers, at least not to Afghans.[1] He eventually decided and managed to leave Croatia and told me his tale when he was freshly arrived in Trieste, where he would apply for and eventually obtain asylum. Croatia’s position in refugees’ mental geography of the so-called Balkan Route has become clearer since those early days, and more sharply defined: had my friend hit the border four or five years later, he would not have thought of grabbing the chance to seek asylum there. Croatia is now largely seen by migrants as an obstacle to overcome during their hoped-for movement westwards and its security forces and government’s attitude as uncompromisingly hostile. Maybe it is not so paradoxical that Afghan migrants’ increasingly poor perception of Croatia has developed in the same years that saw the completion of Croatia’s accession to full EU membership. In January 2023, it made the last two big steps forward, with the adoption of the EU’s common currency, the euro, and entry into the Schengen Agreement, a treaty which led to the creation of the Schengen Area in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. Bulgaria and Romania are members of the EU, but not Schengen, while Greece, a Schengen member, has a sea border with the rest of the Union, something which facilitates its control of migrants’ movement. That leaves Croatia, together with Hungary to the north, the main external border for those approaching the EU from the southeast. EU strategies and concerns about what it deems ‘the migrant crisis’, therefore inform Croatia’s policies and behaviour towards migrants more than the internal political debate about them. This is also because, so far, despite the migrants having a highly visible presence, very few have stopped and settled in Croatia. However, an increase in the number of asylum requests filed in Croatia during the first months of 2023 pointed to possible imminent changes in the country’s position and role in migration along the Balkan Route, and inspired this research and report. Let us then first have a look at some numbers. Asylum seekers in Croatia: inflow and outflow. In the first six months of 2023, the most important entry to the EU for Afghans remained what is known as the Western Balkan route.[2] It was along this route that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, listed the highest numbers of detections of illegal border crossings by Afghan nationals 6,392 far more than the 2,437 detections along the Eastern Mediterranean route (from Turkey into Greece or Bulgaria or from Turkey by sea to the Greek islands or to Italy).[3] The Frontex numbers look to be an undercount given the increasing trend in migration in recent years. Moreover, in 2022, in Croatia alone, the Ministry of Interior reported far more: 14,877 illegal border crossings and 1,390 asylum requests provided by the Ministry of Interior. Actual figures for Afghans travelling along the Western Balkan route must be even higher, given there are also undetected border crossings by Afghans. For example, in 2022, Hungary effected more than 25,300 pushbacks of Afghan nationals to Serbia, according to its police statistics (quoted by the Asylum Information Database AIDA). A majority of Afghans, moreover, unlike Syrians who typically try to cross north into Hungary (the most direct route to their destinations in northern Europe), opt to keep moving west, from Serbia through Bosnia and then Croatia, on the western branch of the Balkan Route which leads towards Italy. This will be the specific focus of this report.[4] The constant flow of Afghans arriving at Italy’s north-eastern border further provides a glimpse of the overall numbers moving through Croatia. In 2022, the number of migrants crossing from Slovenia into Italy, traced by the Border Police of Trieste, or who spontaneously presented themselves to the authorities there, amounted to around 13,000. This figure coincides roughly with the number of migrants in transit assessed by a group of solidarity organisations active in the city, which also estimated that over half were Afghans, (see their recent report ). In particular, according to them, in the third quarter of 2022, Afghans made up 75 per cent of the total number of migrants transiting through Trieste. In the case of non-accompanied minors arriving in Trieste, Afghans accounted for 85 per cent of the total during 2022. In Croatia itself, these two trends, the increase in the numbers of overall arrivals and of Afghans, were also monitored. In 2022, 12,872 asylum requests (of all nationalities) were made, against a mere 3,039 of 2021 (see AIDA’s annual country report about Croatia). Then in 2023, the first partial data showed an enormous jump in asylum requests: by 20 March, as many as 6,280 individuals had applied for asylum in Croatia, an 800 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2022. By 30 June, according to the Ministry of Interior’s statistics Croatia had received 24,367 asylum requests, among them, the majority (5,925) filed by Afghan nationals. It was difficult not to link the new pace of asylum requests with the changed political and economic situation of 2023 Croatia joining the Schengen agreement and adopting the euro. The game-changer of being inside Schengen, for example, was mentioned by an unnamed police official to the Croatian daily,    *Previously they went to Slovenia, a Schengen member and sought asylum there because then they could no longer be returned to a country outside of Schengen. Now that Croatia in is Schengen, they don’t need to wait to arrive in Slovenia, so they’re asking for asylum here. * Was it possible that a Croatia now in Schengen could become more attractive as a destination for migrants, and that those who had just transited through it, could become more interested in trying to stay, given the country’s fast-expanding economy and its hunger for cheap seasonal labour in tourist sector? Moreover, this year, Croatia fell into line with most other EU countries with respect to the waiting time imposed on asylum seekers before they can legally seek a job; it was brought down from nine months to just three. A second look at the situation however quickly dispelled this theory. Firstly, the assumption that all asylum requests would lead to those seeking asylum remaining in Croatia is misleading. A number of factors point to relatively few new asylum seekers stopping in the country for good. They include the fact that the increase in asylum requests in Croatia was paralleled by migrants transiting through to Trieste. Also, the numbers of recorded illegal entries into Croatia and Slovenia (the next country along the route westwards to Italy) during the first six months of 2023 were roughly equivalent 26,871 and 25,431 respectively (see for example figures given in this report by Ansa ). This points to the outflow of migrants from Croatia into Slovenia keeping pace with the number of new arrivals, including those who applied for asylum. In 2021, researchers at the University of Zagreb had assessed that almost 90 per cent of those applying for asylum in Croatia left the country after a short time, leaving their requests pending. The current estimate is that around 85 per cent do so. Further elements reinforce the likelihood that few of the new asylum seekers stop in Croatia for good. As already mentioned, so far, Afghans constitute by far the most numerous group of asylum seekers in Croatia this year. Yet it is realistic to infer that, in the case of Afghans even more than other national groups, the great majority leave the country and move westwards. According to information shared by a Zagreb-based independent organisation offering legal assistance and advocacy for asylum seekers the Centre for Peace Studies ( Centar za mirovne studije , CMS), asylum requests made by Afghans in Croatia are usually rejected, even after appeal (in both the 2nd and 3rd instances). Despite an increased focus on Afghans on the part of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) and its partner organisations in Croatia, such as CMS, this is not yet reflected in changes in the asylum policy at the national level. Only a negligible number of Afghans, mostly individuals who worked with NATO forces and could prove direct collaboration with Croatians, managed to settle in Croatia after being evacuated in 2021. Few Afghans would choose to stop in a country showing such reticence in granting asylum, especially when they are so close to more attractive destinations deeper inside the EU. Croatian police behaviour towards Afghans likely plays another key role in keeping them on the move. The country’s borders with Bosnia and Serbia are heavily patrolled, along with transit routes in the interior; according to the Croatian Prime minister , 6,700 police guard and patrol the border. The Croatian police often engage in so-called ‘pushbacks’ that is, the immediate and illegal expulsion of individuals who may have applied for asylum if given the opportunity. Migrants intercepted by the police not only close to the border, but even at greater distances from it, are routinely brought back and forced to re-enter Bosnia on foot, without a formal transfer to Bosnian authorities, and usually through deserted tracts of the border far away from their original crossing point. CMS have estimated that around 25,000 pushbacks to Bosnia took place in the years 2019-21 (with smaller numbers to Serbia). The overall number of pushbacks may have slightly diminished in 2022 the Danish Refugee Council counted 3,461 pushbacks to Bosnia; however, Afghan nationals constituted the main victims of this practice, with 919 such cases. In the first six months of 2023, the volume of pushbacks involving Afghans has continued unabated, with 475 recorded. Instances of police abuse against migrants have been consistently reported and denounced by NGO workers and the media in Croatia and elsewhere over the past few years and were recently detailed in a major report by Human Rights Watch . Leaving aside the issue of ‘chain-pushbacks’, which involve more than one country, in this case Slovenia and Italy (more on this later), such abuses range from the blanket denial of access to asylum to arbitrary detention, theft and damage of personal property, physical violence and degrading treatment. As documented in a CMS report , police officers who take part in such operations most often have their faces covered to avoid identification and likewise cover up the pushback as instances of prevention of illegal border crossings. Despite a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that held Croatia responsible for the death of a six-year-old Afghan girl, Madina Hosseini, who was run over by a train after being pushed back by the police to Serbia in 2017, the Croatian police continue with their abusive practices. They have evidently become engrained in the operational routine of Croatian police forces tasked by their and other European governments, which support Croatian border control economically and operationally through Frontex, with checking unauthorised migration. The actions of the Croatian police should be considered an integral part of the deterrence measures put in place to ‘protect’ the whole of the European Union, not just their own country: the push-backs are just one of a range of measures bureaucratic hurdles, low recognition rates and threats of deportations variously deployed by different EU countries. Even when Afghans are not subjected to pushbacks, NGO workers reported that they are often treated worse than other migrant groups, such as the (far fewer) Syrians, so that the idea that they are not welcome in Croatia is quickly and firmly impressed upon the transiting migrants. A number of conversations with Afghan refugees travelling through Croatia corroborated this point. Talking to Afghans outside of Porin Hotel. The main reception centre in Croatia is in the former Hotel Porin, on the southern outskirts of Zagreb. The centre opened in 2011 with a capacity of 600. Although meant for single men, it currently hosts a mixed population which includes several families.[5] The authorities might have considered its location, away from the city centre, to be convenient. It has proved uncomfortable for those living there. There is a foul-smelling major waste disposal nearby, a huge and largely abandoned freight train exchange station and untended expanses of grass. The area swarmed with ravenous mosquitoes even more than the average Zagreb suburbs in the wet and stormy summer of 2023. The camp is closed to all but government personnel and the Red Cross. Médecins Sans Frontières used to have access but has recently suspended its operations there. However, Afghan migrants are regularly to be found moving around the old hotel’s fenced precincts, squatting in the greenery that surrounds it, exchanging information or walking back from the city after a failed departure. At lunchtime, in particular, many Afghans who have not been able to secure accommodation in the complex try to obtain some food from their acquaintances inside. For someone who used to speak to migrants on the Balkan Route a few years back, as well as to those arriving in Trieste, the first contact with Afghans in 2023 Croatia was telling. The first person, a particularly sombre-looking young man from Maidan Wardak, apologised profusely in Dari for requesting to see my ID. He would not talk to me unless he could reassure himself beyond any doubt that I was not linked to either the Croatian security forces or Frontex. I’ve just been let out of police detention, you know. I spent last night in the hold-up. I’d arrived here yesterday morning, the police identified me and sent me to the camp [Porin] . I left the camp shortly after and went to the train station to catch a train and continue my journey. However, before the train started, the police checked it, carriage by carriage, and there was no place to hide. They were very angry at me for leaving the camp, and even more so for having taken the train. They said, “You have no right to board trains or buses here, you can only move around the way you came walking.” They brought me to the police station and kept me there for the night. As soon as I’d fall asleep, somebody would make a noise or shake me to force me to stay awake. Then they let me go, but told me: “Go on or we’ll deport you back to where you came from.” The Croatian police don’t care about us applying for asylum. They only want to fingerprint us because the more fingerprints they take, the more money they receive from the EU. According to CMS in Zagreb, Afghans crossing into Croatia face three possible legal outcomes, if caught by the police and identified as migrants. Some migrants receive access to asylum applications and are subsequently sent to Porin or another reception centre from where most eventually resume their trip westwards. A second possibility is that the person receives a ‘return decision’, a seven-day warrant ordering them to leave Croatia. 30,000 such decisions were issued in 2022, in particular to migrants from Burundi (who used to be able to travel to Serbia without visas) but also to many Afghans. Reportedly, this practice is continuing without a clear pattern and leaves migrants facing an uncertain fate. The return decision in fact can result in their being allowed to continue traveling, or their being held and then pushed back to Bosnia. A third option an expulsion decision has also become more frequent this year (more details in this analysis by Balkaninsight), especially after a ministerial summit of the western Balkan countries and the EU in Rome in April 2023. Migrants may be issued an expulsion decision, which results in Bosnia formally readmitting them. They are delivered to the Bosnian police. This is reported to have happened even after a person asked for asylum in Croatia.[6] Whichever they get authorised to ask for asylum, given a seven-day warrant to leave the country or a formal expulsion decision it is difficult for migrants to make sense of any of it. At least when it comes to Afghan nationals, there were many complaints about the paucity of translation services and communication in general on the part of the police. The complaint of a young man from Takhar province, formerly a member of the Afghan National Army (ANA), was echoed by nearly all his compatriots: “There’s never an interpreter with them [the police], the paperwork is all in Croatian and many policemen don’t even bother to try to speak English with you.” Most Afghans AAN spoke to were convinced they had not applied for asylum in Croatia, although they had given their fingerprints to the European Asylum Dactyloscopy Database (Eurodac). According to the Dublin Regulation, once a person is identified by the Croatian police, their asylum request is up to Croatia to process, because it was their EU country of entry, even if they do not afterwards complete their application there.[7] They are also be liable to be sent back to Croatia, if they travelled on to another EU member state. The readmission of Dublin cases to Croatia is a relatively frequent instance, and actually one on the rise since Croatia’s accession to Schengen, especially by countries with big volumes of Afghan asylum seekers, such as Switzerland. The phenomenon led a group of Croatian NGOs to travel to Bern in mid-June to meet the Swiss Secretary of State for Migration to advocate for a stop to the practice. They cited the lack of sufficient capacity in their country’s reception system for accommodating refugees (read about the delegation in the Swiss press ). Being sent back, of course, does not necessarily prevent migrants from trying to travel west again and apply for asylum elsewhere. The Porin hotel was fully booked during the days AAN was in Zagreb. Afghans hanging around the hotel said that some newcomers had been made to sleep in the hallways and others could simply not be accommodated inside and slept rough in abandoned wagons in the nearby railway area. When the author visited in late July, the rough sleeping was especially grim, as Zagreb was hit by a quite unprecedented hurricane. It caused extensive damage and several deaths in the city. The Croatian capital was ravaged by bouts of heavy rains and wind for the full following week. One of the Afghans sleeping rough outside Porin was a young boy from Dand-e Ghuri in Baghlan province. Hardly looking as old as the 16 years he claimed, he had been sent by the Croatian police to what he termed “a camp for minors” (likely the reception centre in Kutina) upon arrival. He left it after just one day, however, and proceeded to Zagreb, but could not find a place inside Porin. While waiting for some sympathetic compatriot to bring him food from inside the hotel, he related what had led him to leave in haste the arguably better reception he would have received at the camp for minors: I left my country two years ago, shortly before the fall of the Republic. I wasted a lot of time in Turkey because I had no money to pay for the next leg of the trip. I worked as a shepherd near Istanbul, and also in the city, but it was never enough. My family sold everything in order to have me out of Afghanistan. They sold the last sack of rice, even some of the little land they owned. My little sister is at home. My whole family is only waiting for me to get to some place where I can start to help them. It’s two years I’ve been gone and not a single time have I been able to send some shirini [literally ‘sweets’, presents or sums of money given as gifts to relatives, friends or associates] to my father. There’s no money left at home. How could there be? We are sharecroppers: one quarter of our harvest the Taleban take as taxes, one quarter goes to the landlord, one quarter is just for our own consumption to eat and stay alive, and with the sale of the remaining quarter you have to meet all the other expenses of the family. The time I spent in Turkey, the way I used to slave for a small sum of money there made me reflect a lot. Now I need to get somewhere fast, somewhere I can get an education, find a good job, start a different life. As for where this more favourable final destination could be, in the minds of those traveling, there are a few recurrent ideas. While some mention France and potentially further, possibly to the UK, or Switzerland, most seem to be directed to Germany. However, the majority of those interviewed by AAN declared they aimed first to get to Italy, and so were trying to catch a train or bus to Rijeka, Croatia’s Adriatic seaport, only 50 kilometres away as the crow flies from its ‘twin’ city in Italy, Trieste. Migrants cannot fly, however, or even, apparently, be allowed to take a bus or train, but must only walk. Two former members of the ANA from Mazar-e Sharif related what had happened to them the day before: *Yesterday, we went to the main station to catch a train, but the police were on the platform and sent us back to the camp [Porin]. They called a taxi and forced us to take it and followed us in their car. The taxi driver had first said the ride would cost 30 euros and we gave it to him, but then he started saying that it was 30 for each of us and got angry at our refusal to pay the additional money, so he stopped the cab after just a couple of blocks and the police came and threw our backpacks out of the car and we had to walk back to the camp. The policemen told us we could continue our trip, but not by any form of transport. They even threatened us: Go quick, move on or we’ll deport you back to Afghanistan. * Taxi drivers are a key component in what Afghans call ‘the Game’, played along this section of the route, both as transporters of migrants for short distances, but also, often, as police informers. From Serbia onwards, the role of traffickers is much less direct and their presence on the ground negligible. Of course, there are those traveling under more high-profile and costly arrangements, such as direct transport by vehicle, which according to one police investigation can cost up to 5,000 euros from Bosnia to Italy or up to 8,000 euros if somebody wants to get further west, for example to Spain. However, most migrants, especially single young men, are left to themselves after they leave Serbia and cross the border into Bosnia. The traffickers keep in touch over the phone and provide guidance by sending GPS positions which they must reach, stage by stage. A short distance from the gates of Porin, the author met a group of Afghans squatting in the tall grass, listening attentively to a twenty-year old from Bagram talking in Pashto with smugglers on his phone. He was telling them about the difficulty of boarding public transport and the poor conditions of his and his companions’ feet after the tiresome trekking they had been forced to do in the previous days and afterwards recounted to the author his recent journey. I arrived two days ago. I slept outside Porin, I cannot enter [the complex] or eat there as I gave no fingerprints to the police I actually have not met any so far. I came all the way with a friend from my district. We paid 3,000 USD to travel from Turkey to Serbia. During that part of the trip, we always had a rahbalad [guide]* with us and when we were detained for some days in Bulgaria, somebody from our smuggler network waited until we were out and guided us into Serbia. From Serbia onwards, we were alone. Now it works through ‘locations’ only. The smugglers give you a series of locations via GPS and you follow them: a station, a road, a border crossing.* *From Belgrade, they brought us to a river border and told us to jump into the water to get into Bosnia. On the other side we took a taxi. It cost 50 euros for each of the passengers to be brought close to Bihac. Then we went to a camp called Lipa and after around a week, we crossed into Croatia. On the way, there were people coming back to the camp whose phones had been broken or stolen by the Croatian police. We crossed a forest which had no paths. Luckily we met no police, although we could hear the drones buzzing over our heads. Then we walked until Zagreb. Now we’re waiting for the new location from our contact. Altogether, for the trip, Bosnia to Italy *[with locations], you pay 700 USD if the trafficker is a rafiq [a friend or associate] , otherwise 800 USD. The chances are that somebody among the migrants gets a discount if he becomes a jelawro (‘lead-the-way’), informally taking charge of a small group and keeping in touch with the smuggler network to enhance the group’s possibilities of successfully arriving at the next stage (and the smugglers’ of getting paid in full). Recently, there have been press reports about an increase in the number of traffickers arrested by the Croatian police. According to CMS, many of these arrests have been made among migrants who had reached Rijeka or other places far from the border with Bosnia. This could point towards their real role, as jelawros , rather than real members of a smuggling network. Besides providing a barrier on behalf of the EU at the border with non-EU Bosnia (it became a candidate country only in December 2022), Croatian police efforts seem directed at keeping pressure on migrants to move on once they are inside Croatia. Over the past few years, for example, the route from Zagreb to Rijeka (by train or bus), from Rijeka (by train) to the inland town of Buzet on the Istrian peninsula (the westernmost area of Croatia which bulges out into the Adriatic Sea) and from there on foot across Slovenian territory (at its narrowest point around 15 km) and into Italy, had become well-established. Police crackdowns on migrants in Rijeka have recently caused part of the flow to shift towards Pula, a seaport at the tip of the Istrian peninsula, a detour for those trying to get to Italy. The aim of this ‘keeping migrants on the move’ is probably to make sure one single route does not become too prominent and crowded, with the risk of it developing into a public scandal or something which could tarnish the image of the country advertised as a tourist paradise. Crossing Croatia is not as gruelling as crossing Bulgaria, with its higher levels of abuse and violence, or an impassable obstacle such as Hungary. Still, it comes like a cold shower for migrants convinced that they have finally overcome the harshest part of their trip, that they are finally on the doorstep of western Europe and that with that, will come better standards of reception and human rights, as one man said: In Serbia and Bosnia, the people are good and the police don’t bother us migrants. *In Croatia, we’re treated like animals. Elsewhere, the violence, the hostile behaviour is on the border and once you’ve made it away from there, you’re fine, people aren’t hostile and the police don’t bother you. So, once you’ve arrived here in Zagreb from the forests on the Bosnian border, you think you’ve come out of the jangal [the jungle, here used also in a figurative sense] and reached ‘the city’. But then, you realise that the behaviour of the police here in the capital is the same as on the border. Actually, the police here mistreat you as you would expect someone to do in the jungle, while out there in ‘the jungle’ [referring here to the refugee camps of the Bosnian Una-Sana canton, located in forested areas] people were treating us in a more civilised way. * The Zagreb government’s hostile attitude is compounded by the migrants’ own lack of interest in remaining in Croatia; hence, they seldom reach out to the very committed organisations which offer legal aid and other forms of support. The positive perception of police and Bosnian and Serbian people’s attitudes noted by the two ex-soldiers from Mazar and many other migrants AAN spoke to reflected their personal experience, that is, of a relatively swift and smooth crossing. However, the full picture is not so rosy nor so simple in Serbia and Bosnia, which have been at the centre of the ‘migrant crisis’ for years, as the author discovered when he took a closer look at the situation of Afghan migrants still in Serbia. Talking and walking in Belgrade. For many migrants, having experienced a first taste of the EU in Greece or Bulgaria, Serbia may look like a comparatively relaxed stage of the trip. Access to asylum-seeking is available, but not everywhere: according to members of a Serbian NGO providing legal and psychosocial support to migrants, Klikaktiv , the police do not easily provide the possibility to register outside Belgrade and even in the capital, this opportunity is not available at all times. Despite improvements in the reception capacity of the 17 camps active across Serbia, for which the EU is the major funder, not many possibilities are offered to those who apply for asylum besides accommodation. The wait to legally seek employment amounts to nine months and, before a positive decision has been made, according to migrants solidarity organisations in Belgrade, no language or professional courses are available. At any given moment, there are around 3,000 migrants hosted in the reception centres, but very few opt to remain in Serbia. Most move quickly on to Bosnia and Croatia. Serbia’s role is mainly one of transit, and in recent years, of an increasingly swift transit. According to the annual report by the Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migration, 124,127 migrants were registered and hosted in reception centres during 2022. On average, they stayed in the country for 16 days, a considerable decrease from the 30 days of 2021 or the 36 of 2020. Reportedly, over 73,000 migrants had already transited through Serbia’s camps in the first six months of 2023. Afghans were the most represented nationality to pass through the Serbian reception centres in 2022, amounting to over 36 per cent of the total. It is often vulnerable cases, families or people with medical conditions who access reception centres out of their own free will. They may need to stop for a short while in order to recover, while other migrants try to continue on their path almost immediately. Outside the official camps, there is indeed another migrant population in Serbia, estimated at between 3-4,000 and constantly flowing into and out of the country and thereby renewing itself. This is centred on smugglers’ rented safehouses and the many squats located on the northern border with Hungary. At the western border with Bosnia, there is also a constant flow, but far less ‘housing’ because it is easier and quicker to cross. The crossing into Bosnia is also the route generally favoured by Afghans, many of whom therefore end up stopping in Serbia for only a couple of days. According to both migrants and NGO workers interviewed by AAN, crossing into Bosnia is now relatively easy. From Belgrade, migrants move to minor border crossings near quiet towns in western Serbia such as Loznica. Migrants described wading or swimming across rivers though crossing the Drina, which largely marks the border between the two countries, would require along most of its course advanced swimming skills read here about migrants stranded mid-river. Different interviewees also related crossing rivers by bridges, either secretly, through a system of ropes hung under the bridge, or quite openly just walking across. At some minor border crossings, such as Ljubovija, migrants can be taken across the river into Bosnia directly by car: according to the Serbian NGO, Klikaktiv, it is relatively common to see cavalcades of vehicles with non-local plates crossing this and other nearby ‘sleepy’ border towns. Some migrants may be picked up by cars on the Bosnian side. These ‘all-inclusive’ migrants who pay more and travel fast, stay with smugglers throughout, and are often brought directly to the Croatian frontier and even beyond.[8] The average migrant, however resorts to public transport once on the Bosnian side. On both sides of the frontier, the police often opt to close their eyes to migrants’ crossing, or can be bribed by smugglers if necessary. The lax attitude of the police in Serbia has often been commented positively on by migrants and looks to be a constant from AAN’s previous visit to the country’s migrant squats in 2016 (read this and the other reports from the series). However, things might be changing in this respect, as episodes of violent repression of migrants at border crossings have recently been documented and seem to be on the rise. Klikaktiv has also reported police pressure on migrants trying to use public transport to reach Belgrade from the south. The shift in Serbian police attitudes is not happening only at the borders: a short walk in downtown Belgrade in the same places researched in 2016 at the height of the ‘first Balkan Route crisis’, showed that a lot had changed in the city as well. The area of the once dilapidated central train station in the Savamala neighbourhood, that has since been relocated, has been transformed into a new upscale Belgrade Waterfront project, radically changing the city skyline and profile of the neighbourhood. This means also that the migrants’ presence in the area, previously a ‘natural’ hub for those transiting, is nowadays less tolerated. Around the remains of the old train station in Savamala (read here a report on BBC Serbian about its past glory, and last days), the absence of refugees is made more conspicuous by the signs of their previous presence: PCO shops, where people could phone home or contact smugglers, and kebabs once lining the main avenue are now shut, together with the cheap hostels that would accommodate families or migrants coming to Serbia in a more high-profile way.[9] Tents and shacks have disappeared and illegal squats inside the abandoned wagons near the old train station have been removed. Serbian police are known to raid such urban squats in order to destroy them and deport their occupants to the camps inid near the Croatian border or in Preevo near the border with North Macedonia (read    by Klikaktiv). The nearby park, universally known by migrants as ‘Afghan Park’ since at least 2015, where smugglers used to hold court (read this instalment of the previous AAN series on Afghan migrants in Serbia) now looks to be only frequented by migrants part-time. With the coming of spring and then summer, it started to fill again with newcomer migrants arriving from the Bulgarian or Macedonian border, but they do not spend all their time there and are frequently rounded up and forcibly relocated by the police to camps far away from the city. Arriving at Afghan Park one morning shortly after 11am, the author could witness from afar such an operation. Two dozen migrants, seemingly Afghans, had been made to sit on the grass while a dozen police agents counted and identified them in order to have them board a big police bus, already waiting by the side of the road. Some civilians stayed there throughout the process, possibly NGO workers who had come with their own translator to make sure the migrants were advised and accounted for and that none ended being pushed out of Serbia. Moving a couple of lanes above the park, in front of a line of shops selling hiking gear, a few migrants were apparently waiting for the police operation to be over before moving out of cover. Three were Afghans from the southeast, speaking Pashto over the phone and a bit uneasy about speaking Dari to a stranger. They hurried to declare that they were already accommodated in a camp at the outskirts of the city and had only come to town to do some shopping. Walking down another lane leading back to the park, there was another group of Afghans who had apparently left it in the wake of the police arrival. They were mostly Pashto speakers as well, with at least two very young boys among them. Although arguably keen to put more distance between them and the police bus on the other side of the road, they did not look over-concerned by it (the vehicle was also shielding them from the agents inside the park). However, the conversation with them was cut abruptly short by an old lady from a balcony above, who started protesting loudly that it was not permitted to talk to migrants (arguably taking the author for a local). She kept urging the migrants to go back and immediately report to the police in the park, as it was not allowed for them to stay in the city. Indeed, the Afghans did not look at ease stopping anywhere in the area and kept hurrying onwards, so the interview had to be continued while walking several hundred metres. It was a full reversal of how easy it was to spot and engage in conversation with migrants in Belgrade only a few years back. The information they provided was necessarily sketchy, but its interpretation made somewhat easier by the circumstances. They had not been stopped by the Serbian police and had kept clear of the camps. Although they claimed they were sleeping in various city parks, they seemed to be following a clear leader a tall, bearded guy walking a few dozen metres ahead of them and had shopping bags full of food with them. They said they would stop to rest for a couple of days before hitting ‘the game’ towards Bosnia. When asked if they were ‘ khod-andaz ’ (migrants who self-organise their trip) or were with smugglers, they seemed to find the idea funny and replied “We’re with smugglers, of course.” They added that the police in the park did not see them and they did not wish to be seen, else the police might bring them back to the camps “two hours away [located in the south of Serbia].” They complained that the Serbian police were making some problems for migrants, that people were forced to go to the camps and that the police sometimes sent some of their number back to Bulgaria. On returning to the park, I found it deserted. The migrants had boarded the police bus, which seemed now ready to start. The whole process had taken around one and a half hours. A few more Afghans, altogether not more than half a dozen, were squatting or sleeping in the more secluded parts of the park esplanade in front of the old train station, now a restored monument, not creating even a visible trouble to passers-by. Ironically, above their heads, a big travel agency placard atop an unfinished building promised that with it: “Every day, you could go to Turkey.” Discussions with NGO workers and researchers at Belgrade University confirmed the impression that, regardless of the still significant numbers of migrants passing through Belgrade, they are much less visible in the city. The causes for this are the authorities’ changed attitude, as well also the nature of the operations run by the smuggling networks in Serbia. Migrants constitute a minor source of concern for the Serbian government, provided they do not become too visible in central areas of the city. To disincentivise their presence, besides raids and forced relocation to camps out of the city, the authorities have discontinued the provision of services to migrants in the area. The main hub offering assistance to migrants in the city centre was Miksalite. It had been transformed over the years from a volunteer organisation to a state-run info point (read this paper on its history and the transformations of migrants reception in Belgrade), forced to relocate in 2016 due to the demolitions planned for the Belgrade Waterfront and was shut down for good on 31 December 2022. The withdrawal of the state left a free hand once again for the smugglers, not only to arrange for the migrants to cross frontiers in a swift way, but to organise every other aspect of their stay in Serbia. Today, migrants who do not seek reception in the government camps are fully dependent on the smugglers for transport, accommodation, food and communications hence the lack of need for PCO shops and food stalls. This of course, has its consequences. Migrants who cannot pay smugglers can face serious abuses and are often exploited for labour or sex. Many such migrants have to work for the smugglers in assisting the accommodation or transport of other migrants and are kept in isolation and are very difficult to access, whether by NGOs keen to help, or the security forces. The situation is of particular concern for vulnerable categories, such as unaccompanied minors Klikaktiv assessed that in the first six months of 2023, there were three times as many of these crossing Serbia compared to the same period last year. Recently, there have also been numerous instances of violence between smugglers, believed to be caused by competition between rival groups. The string of violence started in July last year, with a shooting between two rival groups of Afghan smugglers in a squat near the northern border with Hungary, which ended in one member killed and also caused serious injuries to an Iranian girl who was caught in the crossfire. The episode made some impression on the Serbian media back then, but this year, despite several similar incidents at least five, including one recorded in March on the border with Bosnia which resulted in the death of an Afghan they have not attracted much public interest nor police reaction. The fact that they happened in liminal places, such as migrants’ squats or in remote border towns and did not involve Serbian nationals, has so far kept the profile of such crimes low in the eyes of the state and public. Klikaktiv, however, denouncing the threat posed by smugglers to migrants and NGO workers, indeed all citizens, lamented the lack of political will to deal with the problem on the part of the authorities (see their",9367,number afghan refugee move balkan route remain high summer large proportion take long trip central western northern europe early twenty age turkey usually cross greece

423300231,"(Excerpt) Brief report about Flash Flood Incident in Sikkim due to suspected Lake Outburst/Cloudburst as on 10.10.2023 at 1800 hrs. 1. Brief background of the incident: In the early hours of 4thOctober 2023, there was a sudden surge in flow of Teesta River, which washed away several bridges, damaged parts of NH-10, Chungthang Dam and had impacted several small towns and several infrastructure projects in the upper reaches of the Teesta River valley. The districts of Namchi, Gangtok, Mangan and Pakyong are severely affected. While scientists are still investigating the exact cause of the flash flood, the primary reason for the sudden surge has been found to be a GLOF (Glacial Lake Outburst Flood) event at South Lhonak lake in North Sikkim. The lake is at a height of 5,200 meters, with a towering ice-capped feature at about 6,800 meters to the north of and in close proximity to the lake. Satellite images received from NRSC, ISRO, reveal the draining out of more than half the lake. CWC’s monitoring stations revealed that the first surge of water was 19 meters above the maximum water level at Sangkalang at 0130 hrs, falling to 4 meters above the maximum water level at Melli at 0400 hrs.",9367,excerpt brief report flash flood incident sikkim suspect lake outburst cloudburst hrs brief background incident early hour sudden surge flow teesta river wash away bridge damage part chungthang dam impact small town infrastructure project upper reach teesta river valley district namchi gangtok mangan pakyong severely affect scientist investigate exact cause flash flood primary reason sudden surge find glof glacial lake outburst flood event south lhonak lake north sikkim lake height meter tower ice cap feature meter north close proximity lake satellite image receive nrsc isro reveal draining half lake cwc monitoring station reveal surge water meter maximum water level sangkalang hrs fall meter maximum water level melli hrs
423299041,"Key Messages. Key messages for this weekly report are presented below: Rainfall and its forecast Rainfall focused in the areas from Chiang Saen in Thailand to Tan Chau and Chau Doc in Viet Nam, including the upper, middle and lower parts of the LMB covering Lao PDR and Cambodia, varying from 21.90 millimetres (mm) to 277.30 mm. There will be below moderate and moderate rainfall for the next 5 days over the Mekong region from 10 to 14 October 2023 although there is no any movement of tropical storm moving towards the Mekong region. Water level and its forecast - According to MRC’s observed water level at Jinghong, it showed fluctuating water levels between 536.12 m and 537.13 m during 03-09 October 2023. The current level is staying about 0.86 m higher than its LTA value. The outflow at Jinghong station varied between 1,460.00 m3 /s and 2,270.00 m3 /s between 03 and 09 October 2023. With the fluctuated outflow from Jinghong upstream and rainfall at catchment inflow, water levels of monitoring stations at Chiang Saen in Thailand increased about 0.26 m from 03 to 09 October 2023, staying about 0.41 m lower than its LTA level. Water level at Xieng Kok upstream of Chiang Saen increased about 1.61 m. Water level at Chiang Khan in Thailand from 03 to 09 October 2023 decreased about 0.07 m and stayed about 1.14 m higher than its LTA value, while water level at Vientiane decreased about 0.53 m staying about 1.72 higher than its LTA level. Water levels at Nong Khai decreased 0.95 m and stayed about 0.75 m lower than its LTA, while at Paksane it decreased about 0.40 m, staying about 0.57 m higher than its LTA value. Water levels at these stations are considered normal. Water levels from Nakhon Phanom to Pakse increased from 0.08 m to 0.65 m, due to the contribution of moderate to heavy rainfalls and inflows from upstream. The current WLs at these stations are staying higher than their LTA value, considering normal. From the stretches of the river at Stung Treng, water levels decreased about 0.44 m and stayed 0.83 m higher than its LTA values, while at Kratie the water levels decreased about 1.34 m and stayed 1.02 m higher than their LTA values, which were considered normal. Water level at Kompong Cham is about 0.14 m lower than its LTA value. The water volume of the Tonle Sap Lake was lower than its LTA (about 72%) during the same period from 03 to 09 October 2023, which is considered low. Water levels from downstream at Chaktomuk and Phnom Penh Port, Koh Khel on the Bassac river in Cambodia decreased between 0.05 m and 0.10 m, staying lower than their LTA level excepted at Kho Khel the water level is stayed higher than its LTA level. Water levels at Prek Kdam on the Tonle Sap River increased about 0.10 m, staying 1.01 m lower than its LTA value. The current water levels for most of the stations are lower than their LTA value. WLs at the 2 tidal stations at Tan Chau and Chau Doc were fluctuating and lower than their LTA value, due to tidal effect during this monitoring period, considered critical. Over the next five days, the water levels at the middle and lower parts from Nakhon Phanom to Stung Treng and Kratie will go down due to low-average rainfall and dam/reservoir operations upstream, while at downstream from Phnom Penh down to the Mekong floodplain area they are also going to fall. Drought condition and its forecast During Sep 25-Oct 1, the LMB was not facing any serious threat. Only Phongsaly of Lao PDR was having some moderate drought. Other areas were normal or wet.

423294880,"Seventy-eighth session Item 73 (c) of the provisional agenda* Promotion and protection of human rights: human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives. Situation of human rights in Afghanistan. Note by the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General has the honour to transmit to the General Assembly the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution    Summary. The present report, submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, builds on his previous report and covers developments, mainly from February to August 2023. I. Introduction. 1. The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 51/20 . , provides an outline of human rights developments in Afghanistan, mainly between February and August 2023. It builds on the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session (A/77/552), as well as his reports to the Human Rights Council. 2. To date, the Special Rapporteur has undertaken three missions to Afghanistan since assuming the mandate in May 2022, including a joint mission with the Chair of the Working Group on discrimination against women and girls in April and May 2023. 3. During these missions, the Special Rapporteur visited Kabul, Mazar-e Sharif, Kandahar, Bamyan and Panjshir Provinces. He met with numerous stakeholders and was received by senior de facto officials, including the acting Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers and senior officials at the provincial level. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the de facto authorities’ cooperation with the mandate, including their written submissions to his communications and reports. 4. The Special Rapporteur also engaged in regular interactions with a broad range of stakeholders outside the country, by participating in in-person and online events. II. Background. 5. Since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate. While a broad spectrum of rights has been restricted or abused by the de facto authorities, the most prominent case is the extreme curtailment of the rights of women and girls. The de facto authorities have introduced numerous edicts and instructions that have deprived women and girls of their basic rights, including the rights to education, work, freedom of movement and participation in political and public life. These restrictions include bans on Afghan women from working for non-governmental organization (NGOs) in December 2022 and for the United Nations in April 2023, which have had a negative impact on humanitarian operations across the country. Other fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedom of expression, opinion and assembly, the rights to life, physical integrity and access to justice, and the rights of minorities, have been systematically violated, affecting the entire community. Civic space continues to shrink and civil society activists, journalists and peaceful protesters continue to be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention, and ill-treatment. On 13 November 2022, the de facto authorities announced the reintroduction of qisas (retribution in kind) and hudud (crimes against God) punishments, meaning that the application of the death penalty in public has resumed, alongside other inhuman and degrading punishments. 1 According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), a significant number of individuals were subjected to public flogging, including 74 men, 58 women and 2 boys, between November 2022 and April 2023.2. 6. The Taliban claims not only that their policies are necessary to comply with the sharia, but that they are also popular with Afghans living in the country. This is strongly contested by other Afghans who resist Taliban rule. The continued suppression of women’s rights has undoubtedly had a negative impact on the popularity of the Taliban locally. It has also created major obstacles for any steps towards recognition by the international community. 7. The de facto authorities have failed to establish an administration that is inclusive of women and all ethnic and religious groups. Furthermore, the de facto administration continues to be composed entirely of men, predominantly of Pashtun ethnicity. The Taliban leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, is apparently tightening his direct grip over State affairs, notably the security and intelligence sectors, and the reshuffling of judicial, security and civil officials, in particular at the subnational level, has become more frequent. He has also moved the spokesperson’s office of the de facto authorities from Kabul to Kandahar and established religious councils with decision-making power in over 20 provinces. 8. An estimated 85 per cent of Afghans live below the poverty line and the provision of humanitarian assistance is under stress. More than halfway through the year, the 2023 Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan remains severely underfunded with only $744 million received as at 31 July, which is less than half of the amount ($1.49 billion) received as at the same time in 2022. Bans on Afghan female aid workers have also generated additional financial and operating costs that require greater donor flexibility and funding. The World Food Programme has warned that funding will run out by October 2023 as a result of reduced donor funding, which could further affect millions of Afghans. 9. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly heard from Afghan women and men that the distribution of assistance is frequently uneven and can be difficult to obtain, in particular for minority groups, older persons, female-headed households and persons with disabilities, and that distribution reportedly favours Taliban supporters. The ban on female staff affects the effectiveness of humanitarian actors in delivering services to women and girls, resulting in a narrow focus and reduced understanding of the needs of affected populations.",9367,seventy eighth session item c provisional agenda promotion protection human right human right situation report special rapporteur representative situation human right afghanistan note secretary general secretary general honour transmit general assembly report special rapporteur situation human right afghanistan richard bennett accordance human rights council resolution summary present report submit special rapporteur situation human right afghanistan richard bennett build previous report cover development mainly february august introduction present report submit pursuant human rights council resolution provide outline human right development afghanistan mainly february august build report special rapporteur submit general assembly seventy seventh session report human rights council date special rapporteur undertake mission afghanistan assume mandate include joint mission chair working group discrimination woman girl april mission special rapporteur visit kabul mazar e sharif kandahar bamyan panjshir provinces meet numerous stakeholder receive senior de facto official include act deputy prime ministers ministers senior official provincial level special rapporteur appreciate de facto authority cooperation mandate include write submission communication report special rapporteur engage regular interaction broad range stakeholder outside country participate person online event ii background taliban seize power august human right situation afghanistan continue deteriorate broad spectrum right restrict abuse de facto authority prominent case extreme curtailment right woman girl de facto authority introduce numerous edict instruction deprive woman girl basic right include right education work freedom movement participation political public life restriction include ban afghan woman work non governmental organization ngos december united nations april negative impact humanitarian operation country fundamental right freedom include freedom expression opinion assembly right life physical integrity access justice right minority systematically violate affect entire community civic space continue shrink civil society activist journalist peaceful protester continue subject arbitrary arrest detention ill treatment november de facto authority announce reintroduction qisa retribution kind hudud crime god punishment mean application death penalty public resume alongside inhuman degrading punishment accord united nations assistance mission afghanistan unama significant number individual subject public flogging include man woman boy november april taliban claim policy necessary comply sharia popular afghans live country strongly contest afghans resist taliban rule continued suppression woman right undoubtedly negative impact popularity taliban locally create major obstacle step recognition international community de facto authority fail establish administration inclusive woman ethnic religious group furthermore de facto administration continue compose entirely man predominantly pashtun ethnicity taliban leader haibatullah akhundzada apparently tighten direct grip state affair notably security intelligence sector reshuffling judicial security civil official particular subnational level frequent move spokesperson office de facto authority kabul kandahar establish religious council decision make power province estimated cent afghans live poverty line provision humanitarian assistance stress halfway year afghanistan humanitarian response plan remain severely underfunded million receive july half billion receive time ban afghan female aid worker generate additional financial operating cost require great donor flexibility funding world food programme warn funding run october result reduced donor funding affect million afghans special rapporteur repeatedly hear afghan woman man distribution assistance frequently uneven difficult obtain particular minority group old person female head household person disability distribution reportedly favour taliban supporter ban female staff affect effectiveness humanitarian actor deliver service woman girl result narrow focus reduce understanding need affect population
423295281,"Septuagésimo octavo período de sesiones Tema 73 c) del programa provisional* Promoción y protección de los derechos humanos: situaciones de los derechos humanos e informes de relatores y representantes especiales. Situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán. Nota del Secretario General. El Secretario General tiene el honor de transmitir a la Asamblea General el informe del Relator Especial sobre la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán, Richard Bennett, de conformidad con la resolución    del Consejo de Derechos Humanos. Resumen. El presente informe, elaborado por el Relator Especial sobre la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán, Richard Bennett, se basa en su informe anterior y abarca la evolución de la situación principalmente entre febrero y agosto de 2023. I. Introducción. 1. En el presente informe, elaborado en cumplimiento de la resolución 51/20 del Consejo de Derechos Humanos, se resume la evolución de la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán, principalmente entre febrero y agosto de 2023. El informe se basa en el que el Relator Especial presentó a la Asamblea General en su septuagésimo séptimo período de sesiones ( A/77/552 ), así como en sus informes al Consejo de Derechos Humanos. 2. Desde que asumió el mandato en mayo de 2022 y hasta la fecha, el Relator Especial ha llevado a cabo tres misiones en el Afganistán, incluida una misión conjunta con la Presidenta del Grupo de Trabajo sobre la cuestión de la discriminación contra las mujeres y las niñas en abril y mayo de 2023. 3. Durante esas misiones, el Relator Especial visitó las provincias de Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar, Bamiyán y Panjsher. Se reunió con numerosas partes interesadas y fue recibido por altos funcionarios de la administración de facto, entre ellos los Vice Primeros Ministros interinos, Ministros y altos funcionarios provinciales. El Relator Especial agradece a las autoridades de facto su cooperación con el mandato, en particular sus contribuciones escritas a sus comunicaciones e informes. 4. El Relator Especial también mantuvo contactos periódicos con un amplio abanico de partes interesadas fuera del país, mediante su participación en eventos presenciales y en línea. II. Antecedentes. 5. Desde que los talibanes tomaron el poder en agosto de 2021, la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán ha seguido deteriorándose. Si bien las autoridades de facto han restringido o vulnerado un amplio espectro de derechos, el ejemplo más destacado es la restricción extrema de los derechos de las mujeres y las niñas. Las autoridades de facto han emitido numerosos edictos y órdenes que han privado a las mujeres y las niñas de sus derechos básicos, entre ellos los derechos a la educación, al trabajo, a la libertad de circulación y a la participación en la vida política y pública. Esas restricciones comprenden la prohibición de que las mujeres afganas trabajen para organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG), impuesta en diciembre de 2022, y para las Naciones Unidas, impuesta en abril de 2023, lo que ha repercutido negativamente en las operaciones humanitarias en todo el país. Además se han violado sistemáticamente otros derechos y libertades fundamentales, como las libertades de expresión, de opinión y de reunión, los derechos a la vida, a la integridad física y al acceso a la justicia, y los derechos de las minorías, lo que ha afectado a toda la comunidad. El espacio cívico sigue reduciéndose, y los activistas de la sociedad civil, los periodistas y los manifestantes pacíficos siguen siendo objeto de detención y reclusión arbitrarias, y de malos tratos. El 13 de noviembre de 2022, las autoridades de facto anunciaron la reinstauración de los castigos en aplicación de la quisas (ley del talión) y por delitos hudud (crímenes contra Dios), lo que significa que se ha vuelto a aplicar la pena de muerte en público, junto con otros castigos inhumanos y degradantes. Según la Misión de Asistencia de las Naciones Unidas en el Afganistán (UNAMA), entre noviembre de 2022 y abril de 2023 se sometió a flagelación pública a un número considerable de personas, a saber, 74 hombres, 58 mujeres y 2 niños. 6. Los talibanes afirman no solo que sus políticas son necesarias para cumplir la sharia islámica, sino también que son populares entre los afganos que viven en el país, una afirmación que rechazan enérgicamente otros afganos que se oponen al régimen talibán. No cabe duda de que la supresión sistemática de los derechos de las mujeres ha afectado a la popularidad de los talibanes a nivel local. También ha dificultado enormemente cualquier paso hacia el reconocimiento por la comunidad internacional. 7. Las autoridades de facto no han establecido una administración que incluya a las mujeres y a todos los grupos étnicos y religiosos. Es más, la administración de facto sigue estando integrada exclusivamente por hombres, predominantemente de etnia pastún. Los informes indican que el líder talibán, Haibatullah Akhundzada, está estrechando su control directo sobre los asuntos de Estado, en particular en los sectores de seguridad e inteligencia, y cada vez son más frecuentes las reorganizaciones de funcionarios judiciales, civiles y de seguridad, sobre todo a nivel subnacional. También ha trasladado la oficina del portavoz de las autoridades de facto de Kabul a Kandahar y ha establecido consejos religiosos con facultades decisorias en más de 20 provincias. 8. Se calcula que el 85 % de los afganos vive por debajo del umbral de pobreza, y la prestación de ayuda humanitaria pasa por grandes dificultades. Transcurrida más de la mitad del año, el Plan de Respuesta Humanitaria para el Afganistán de 2023 sigue teniendo un déficit grave de financiación, ya que al 31 de julio solamente había recibido 744 millones de dólares, monto que representa menos de la mitad del recibido en la misma fecha de 2022 (1.490 millones de dólares).

Plan International has had a presence in the Pacific region since 2012. PIP operates as a Country Office (CO), with the Fiji Hub functioning as the CO and offices in Bougainville (PNG) and the Solomon Islands as program units (PUs). PIP reports directly to the Asia-Pacific (APAC) regional office in Bangkok. There has been a historical transition of programs internally in Plan Intonational from Plan International Australia (PIA) to APAC in 2020.

This Terms of Reference serves as a guide for a consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of Plan International Pacific's operational and program model for future sustainability. The consultant is expected to engage with relevant stakeholders, provide recommendations, and present findings to facilitate informed decision-making. Additional input from relevant stakeholders and documents will be incorporated into the review process as needed. Due to the complexity of internal/external data, systems, processes, and progress to date, further details will be provided to the preferred candidate/s to support the preferred approach for the review. 4.

423317346,"The objective of this study was to assess the combined impact of environmental microplastic pollution and biological invasion which represent critical global eco-environmental challenges. The invasion of Solidago canadensis L. and soil microplastic contamination in the agroecosystem pose severe hazards to soil and plant ecology and human health. Oryza sativa L. (rice) was examined after individual and combined exposure to Solidago canadensis L. invasion (SI) and soil polyethylene microplastic contamination (MPc). Comparing the individual and combination treatments to the control, leaf biomass decreased, with varying changes in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Antioxidant enzyme activity and reactive oxygen species levels were significantly reduced following SI exposure and increased following the combined treatment (SI × MP). In contrast, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase activities were reduced after the combined treatment. Due to the confluence of various abiotic stressors, the combined treatment had a higher impact on leaf metabolites than the singular SI and MPc treatments. However, in comparison, the combined treatment significantly influenced the metabolic profile. In conclusion, the interaction between SI and MPc resulted in significant metabolic alterations. These changes were characterized by shifts in metabolite pools influenced by antioxidant enzyme activities and nutrient content, ultimately enhancing defense mechanisms within rice crops. Consequently, these stressors threaten the food safety, sustainability, and agricultural output of crops. The co -exposure of invasive plants and microplastics sheds light on the bio-ecological risks associated with microplastics in staple foods and offers valuable insights into the phytotoxicity of invasive plants in the presence of polyethylene microplastics.",9367,objective study assess combine impact environmental microplastic pollution biological invasion represent critical global eco environmental challenge invasion solidago canadensis soil microplastic contamination agroecosystem pose severe hazard soil plant ecology human health oryza sativa rice examine individual combine exposure solidago canadensis invasion si soil polyethylene microplastic contamination mpc compare individual combination treatment control leaf biomass decrease vary change carbon nitrogen phosphorus antioxidant enzyme activity reactive oxygen specie level significantly reduce follow si exposure increase follow combine treatment si mp contrast ascorbate peroxidase catalase activity reduce combine treatment confluence abiotic stressor combine treatment high impact leaf metabolite singular si mpc treatment comparison combine treatment significantly influence metabolic profile conclusion interaction si mpc result significant metabolic alteration change characterize shift metabolite pool influence antioxidant enzyme activity nutrient content ultimately enhance defense mechanism rice crop consequently stressor threaten food safety sustainability agricultural output crop co invasive plant microplastic shed light bio ecological risk associate microplastic staple food offer valuable insight phytotoxicity invasive plant presence polyethylene microplastic
423317349,"Nitrogen cycling is essential to ecosystem functioning and the overall health of our planet. Ammonia, a nitrogen-containing product, as well as a nutrient, is promoted as a low-carbon fuel for the maritime sector, with spectacular production increase in plan. Similar to any other widespread fuels in the past, it is paramount to be prepared for the potential environmental impact of ammonia fuel. Here, through our preliminary calculations using literature data, we suggest that the amount of ammonia to be produced to fulfil the maritime energy need by 2050 may entail large alterations in global nitrogen cycling. Currently, the literature based on limited known cases of ammonia excess is insufficient to quantify the environmental impacts caused by the probable increase in bunkering ammonia release at global scale. With a few knowledge gaps identified, we call on the marine science community to investigate the potential environmental impact related to substantial ammonia excess, contributing new knowledge to a more environmentally sustainable future.",9367,nitrogen cycling essential ecosystem function overall health planet ammonia nitrogen contain product nutrient promote low carbon fuel maritime sector spectacular production increase plan similar widespread fuel past paramount prepare potential environmental impact ammonia fuel preliminary calculation literature datum suggest ammonia produce fulfil maritime energy need entail large alteration global nitrogen cycling currently literature base limited know case ammonia excess insufficient quantify environmental impact cause probable increase bunker ammonia release global scale knowledge gap identify marine science community investigate potential environmental impact relate substantial ammonia excess contribute new knowledge environmentally sustainable future

In a recent interview with the Department of Public Information (DPI), Minister Mustapha reassured that Guyana has adequate water supply to meet essential needs. “I have spoken to the head of hydromet yesterday and he told me by the end of next month we might have some change in the weather. So far, we have enough water in the system to take care of our needs, but that does not mean that we must go about wasting the water. We must conserve the fresh water that we have in the conservancies,” the agriculture minister stated. He noted that currently the water level at the conservancies is at normal height and he hopes that it remains.    Guyana is currently experiencing the El Nino weather phenomenon, however, Minister Mustapha disclosed that there are no serious threats caused by the dry weather conditions. “I don’t think we are experiencing any serious problems with the dry spell so far. We have enough water in the system, but I want to appeal to farmers, stakeholders, and residents generally, we must conserve our fresh water,” Minister Mustapha stated. President Dr Mohamed Irfaan Ali also recently called for persons to conserve water and noted that in some parts of the hinterland.

423337708,"Today, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a new financing partnership to address critical global health opportunities: eradicating polio and ensuring that innovations in health are more accessible to the people who need them most. The World Health Organization and UNICEF, as implementing partners for the polio funding, will deploy the resources to eradicate polio, support the distribution of other childhood immunizations and strengthen health systems so they are better able to respond to emerging health threats. The expected €1.1 billion financing package aims to provide new funding to eradicate a human disease for only the second time in history and help solve the health and development challenges faced by the world’s most vulnerable people, who otherwise do not get fair access to healthcare services and innovations. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: “We are about to wipe polio off the face of the Earth. The European Commission, the EIB and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are partnering to get through the final stretch. With 1 billion euros supported by our European investment strategy Global Gateway, we will invest in stronger health systems globally and local vaccine and medicines production, manufacturing and administration, where it is most needed. Global cooperation has helped us put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it will help us get rid of polio once and for all.” The partnership marks a significant increase in funding for global health and human development under the European Commission’s European Fund for Sustainable Development plus (EFSD+) and is expected to include a match of new complementary funding for global health by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, maximising the impact of every Euro committed by the EU and the European Investment Bank. “Today we are united to write the final chapter in the history of polio. The European Investment Bank is playing its part in a unique partnership with philanthropy and health partners, by providing EUR 500 million for investment in support of the Global Polio Eradication Programme. This initiative will be a milestone in scaling up immunization and strengthening healthcare, ensuring that every child, regardless of their circumstances, can be protected against polio,” said Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank. To promote swift progress towards eradicating wild poliovirus, the partnership aims to deliver €500 million in payments to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative specifically the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The funds will cover polio vaccinations for nearly 370 million children annually; deliver vital health services to children alongside polio campaigns, including measles vaccines and other routine immunizations; and strengthen health systems to better prepare and respond to emerging health threats, as the polio program has done against COVID-19, Ebola, and other diseases. Today, wild poliovirus remains endemic in just two countries Pakistan and Afghanistan and 80% of variant poliovirus cases are found in just four subnational regions. “Thanks to medical innovations, the world eradicated one human disease smallpox. Today we’re on the verge of ending another wild poliovirus. I am committed to ensuring that no child, anywhere in the world, faces this awful disease. I am also optimistic that we will eradicate polio once and for all and make health innovations more accessible for everyone, particularly those in the poorest countries,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Another €500 million aims to expand the innovation capacity of health systems in low- and middle-income countries. This includes new funding to initiatives supported by the European Commission such as efforts to make health innovations like mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics more accessible to people in low- and middle-income countries, under Europe’s investment plan for the world, Global Gateway. More investments in health worldwide will be discussed among global leaders and partners at the upcoming    (25-26 October) “Thanks to the leadership and partnership of the European Commission and European Investment Bank, vaccines, medicines and other life-saving innovations should reach the people who need them most, making communities everywhere healthier. We know that when a community is healthy, economies grow,” said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “Reaching un- or under-vaccinated children in the most remote and hardest-to-reach areas is essential for finishing the job of polio eradication,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These new funds will not only help to drive us towards a polio-free world, but will also help to build more sustainable and resilient health systems to protect the same children and communities who are at risk of polio against the many other health threats they face.” “Polio eradication is within reach, but the progress is fragile, and we must remain laser focused,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “This new funding will help ensure that all children get vaccinated to eradicate polio, while strengthening community-based health systems. No child should suffer from an easily preventable disease.” Specifically, the funding partnership is expected to include: €500 million in new funding for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (as outlined above) €500 million in investments and grants to ensure health innovations are more accessible, strengthen health systems and prepare for future pandemics : The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation plans to provide €250 million of grants and investments to match a €250 million in investments made by the European Investment Bank and guaranteed by the European Fund for Sustainable Development plus. €80 million grants for Technical Assistance: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation expects to match €40 million in grants from the European Commission to provide technical assistance and ensure that global health programs achieve their full potential. The partnership announced today builds from existing partnerships between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Commission and Member States, including a €100 million support package for the recently established African Medicines Agency (AMA) and national African medicines regulatory agencies or regional initiatives, the African Health Diagnostics Platform, which supports African partners to increase access and reduce costs of laboratory testing, and coordination on health initiatives such as COVAX , a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

423376363,"En el marco del Plan Nacional de Prevención del Restablecimiento del Paludismo en Argentina, el Ministerio de Salud de la Nación llevó adelante durante septiembre la campaña nacional de vigilancia entomológica vectorial del paludismo con el objetivo de prevenir la reintroducción de la transmisión autóctona y así mantener la certificación de país libre de esta enfermedad otorgada por la Organización Panamericana de la Salud/Organización Mundial de la Salud (OPS/OMS). Encabezado por la Dirección de Control de Enfermedades Transmitidas por Vectores, y en coordinación con gobiernos provinciales, se desplegó un dispositivo de vigilancia y monitoreo orientado a recolectar datos temporo-espaciales sobre los insectos vectores y detectar de manera oportuna información sobre los parámetros entomológicos, para realizar los ajustes necesarios a las estrategias nacionales y jurisdiccionales de prevención y control de esta problemática de salud. En ese sentido, equipos conformados por agentes técnico-territoriales de la cartera sanitaria nacional, se abocaron a la búsqueda activa del vector del paludismo (mosquitos anofelinos) en las localidades de Yuto (Jujuy), Salvador Mazza, Aguas Blancas (Salta) y Puerto Iguazú (Misiones). En simultáneo con las acciones de monitoreo y vigilancia, se realizaron actividades de capacitación y sensibilización a referentes provinciales y equipos de vigilancia epidemiológica, y se acompañaron procesos de búsqueda activa de casos para realizar estudios diagnósticos. En 2019, la OMS certificó a la Argentina como país libre de paludismo, para casos autóctonos. En este marco, el Ministerio de Salud sostiene y renueva anualmente la implementación del Plan de Prevención de reintroducción del paludismo en Argentina, mediante el cual se establecen los lineamientos para la vigilancia epidemiológica y entomológica, el diagnóstico laboratorial, las acciones para el fortalecimiento en los equipos de salud para el manejo clínico de casos y la articulación con la OPS/OMS para la adquisición de medicamentos y asesoría externa. Que es el paludismo y cómo se transmite. El paludismo o malaria es una enfermedad potencialmente mortal causada por la infección de una o más de cinco especies de parásitos protozoarios intracelulares: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae y Plasmodium knowlesi que se transmiten al ser humano por la picadura de mosquitos hembra infectados del género Anopheles. La transmisión de la enfermedad se produce cuando la hembra del mosquito Anopheles pica a una persona que padece una infección palúdica. Es decir, que contiene en su sangre el parásito plasmodium, y luego el mismo mosquito pica a otra persona sana infectándola.

423375919,"El responsable de la cartera Sanitaria, recorrió la actividad acompañado de agentes socio sanitarios y personal de la dirección de Salud Ambiental. Al respecto, el ministro de Salud Pública, doctor Luis Medina Ruiz , comentó: “Estamos trabajando en la semana de prevención del dengue, como todo el año, previniendo, ya que esta es una amenaza que afortunadamente no hay en Tucumán desde el 1 de agosto, pero si hay en todo el norte de la Argentina, en el Chaco, Bolivia, Brasil y Paraguay”. Y añadió: “Hoy en Lules estamos realizando una buena labor como siempre, junto al gobierno local, con el señor Intendente Carlos Gallia y su equipo en una tarea articulada eliminando los cacharros y concientizando a la población de combatir cualquier criadero de mosquitos, ya sea una tapita, tacho, maceta, cualquier lugar donde pueda haber agua estancada. Hemos encontrado en una manzana de 30 a 40 casas, tres casas que tenían larvas, y lamentablemente, que en una sola casa haya larvas, es suficiente para generar focos de contagio para todas las personas que viven en esa manzana”. “Tenemos que tomar conciencia que el trabajo no termina, todos los días tenemos que controlar nuestra casa, el patio, la plaza cercana y hablar con los vecinos, ponernos de acuerdo entre los vecinos para dar vuelta todos los tachitos, si hay alguno tiene ese borde que parece de suciedad, saber que ahí están los huevitos depositados y allí se desarrollará el mosquito”, agregó. Por su parte; la titular de la Dirección General de Salud Ambiental, ingeniera Julieta Migliavacca , dijo: “Estamos en Lules, realizando un operativo que ha cubierto 12 manzanas, acompañado por el área de Saneamiento Ambiental del municipio que nos ha provisto de máquinas y camiones para la eliminación de los inservibles, y con todo el equipo de la dirección de Salud Ambiental y agentes socio sanitarios del área operativa que nos acompañan en este operativo”. “Hemos encontrado muchas viviendas con recipientes que almacenan agua para riego, así hicimos un trabajo muy importante de concientización a la comunidad sobre la importancia de recambiar esta agua para eliminar los recipientes que son potenciales criadero de mosquitos, mostrándole cuáles son las larvas y las pupas. Hemos encontrado algunos aedes aegypti adultos que, si bien estamos sin circulación de la enfermedad del dengue en este momento en la provincia, son muy importante estas actividades de prevención para bajar la población de aedes, para que en caso de que llegue el dengue tengamos menos posibilidades de transmisión, y sobre todo para que cada uno controle en sus viviendas de los potenciales criaderos”, destacó. Asimismo, la profesional contó que del operativo participaron más de 50 personas, incluyendo agentes del área operativa de Lules y los agentes socio sanitarios. “Trabajamos con ellos que conocen el terreno, a los vecinos que nos abren las puertas de las viviendas, está también el área de prevención de vectores de la dirección de Salud Ambiental con los operarios que tienen el ojo crítico y saben dónde buscar cuando entran a las viviendas”, afirmó. “Es momento de cuidarnos, prevenir, usar repelentes y al primer síntoma consultar al centro asistencial más cercano, para que en caso de sospecha de dengue se pueda detectar ese primer caso y nosotros podamos hacer las acciones de bloqueo”, enfatizó. Finalmente, el secretario de Saneamiento e Inspección de la municipalidad de Lules, licenciado en biotecnología Roberto Ortiz expresó: “Estamos trabajando en forma permanente, siempre con el acompañamiento de nuestro ministro Luis Medina Ruiz , que ha estado en forma permanente en contacto con nosotros, con nuestro intendente en el trabajo contra el dengue. Estamos haciendo concientización casa por casa, en las redes sociales, sobre cómo es el trabajo que hay que hacer para evitar los criaderos de mosquitos.

423381897,"Introducción : Campylobacter spp., es un agente común de enterocolitis en humanos. Los factores de virulencia que más se han relacionado con patogenicidad son la motilidad por la presencia de flagelos, la capacidad de adherencia e invasión a la célula eucarionte y la producción de citotoxinas. La reposición de líquidos y electrolitos es el tratamiento recomendado, y los antimicrobianos se requieren solo en la enfermedad grave y/o prolongada. Objetivo : Caracterizar los factores de virulencia y la resistencia antimicrobiana en cepas de Campylobacter spp., aislados de pacientes con síndrome diarreico agudo en el Laboratorio Central de Salud Pública, periodo 2020 - 2021. Metodología : El tipo de estudio utilizado fue retrospectivo de corte transversal, tomando como periodo de estudio los años 2020 y 2021, como criterio de inclusión se consideraron todas las cepas aisladas de muestras que se remitieron con la ficha epidemiológica para el estudio de Enfermedades Diarreicas Agudas (EDAS) en el periodo de estudio de 2020-2021. Resultados : Fueron sometidas a estudio unas 168 cepas de Campylobacter spp., donde se observó un predominio de la especie Campylobacter jejuni con un porcentaje de 95% (160/168 ) seguido de Campylobacter coli con un 5 % ( 8/168 ). Se detectaron todos los factores de virulencia investigados siendo el de mayor frecuencia flaA (96%) y ctdC (94%), seguido de cadF (86.9%), ctdB (85%), dnaJ (79.7%), racC (71%) y en menor porcentaje se detectó pldA (49%), ciaB (21%), wlaN (13%) y virB (2%). En cuanto a la resistencia antimicrobiana de las cepas de Campylobacter spp., en este estudio se pudo observar un 51 % de resistencia a ciprofloxacina, 6 % de resistencia a tetraciclina; mientras que para eritromicina se observó una sensibilidad del 100%. Conclusión : La identificación de los factores de virulencia implicados en los procesos infecciosos, así como el conocimiento de la resistencia antimicrobiana del agente etiológico constituyen la clave para mejorar la comprensión de la patogénesis y el desarrollo de terapias para el tratamiento de las infecciones presentadas por este patógeno.",9367,introducción campylobacter spp es un agente común de enterocolitis en humano los factor de virulencia que más se han relacionado con patogenicidad son la motilidad por la presencia de flagelos la capacidad de adherencia e invasión la célula eucarionte y la producción de citotoxinas la reposición de líquido y electrolito es el tratamiento recomendado y los antimicrobianos se requieren solo en la enfermedad grave y o prolongada objetivo caracterizar los factor de virulencia y la resistencia antimicrobiana en cepas de campylobacter spp aislado de paciente con síndrome diarreico agudo en el laboratorio central de salud pública periodo metodología el tipo de estudio utilizado fue retrospectivo de corte transversal tomando como periodo de estudio los años y como criterio de inclusión se consideraron todas las cepas aisladas de muestras que se remitieron con la ficha epidemiológica para el estudio de enfermedades diarreicas agudas edas en el periodo de estudio de resultado fueron sometida estudio unas cepas de campylobacter spp donde se observó un predominio de la especie campylobacter jejuni con un porcentaje de seguido de campylobacter coli con un se detectaron todos los factor de virulencia investigados siendo el de mayor frecuencia flaa y ctdc seguido de cadf ctdb dnaj racc y en menor porcentaje se detectó plda ciab wlan y virb en cuanto la resistencia antimicrobiana de las cepas de campylobacter spp en este estudio se pudo observar un de resistencia ciprofloxacina de resistencia tetraciclina mientras que para eritromicina se observó una sensibilidad del conclusión la identificación de los factor de virulencia implicado en los procesos infecciosos así como el conocimiento de la resistencia antimicrobiana del agente etiológico constituyen la clave para mejorar la comprensión de la patogénesis y el desarrollo de terapias para el tratamiento de las infeccione presentada por este patógeno
423394980,"Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 11 oct (EFE).- El Dreamland Gran Canaria continúa con buenas sensaciones en la Eurocup -competición en la que defiende el título- tras superar con solvencia al Ratiopharm Ulm alemán (111-82), resultado que le consolida como líder del Grupo B tras dos jornadas. El base Ferrán Bassas fue el más destacado del encuentro, merced a sus 21 puntos, 4 asistencias y 27 de valoración, en un choque en el que hasta seis jugadores amarillos superaron la decena de puntos. Por los visitantes, LJ Figueroa, con 19 puntos, y Dakota Mathias, con otros 17 y 3 robos de balón, asumieron la batuta ofensiva en el conjunto germano. El encuentro sirvió para refrendar el primer inicio en positivo del conjunto claretiano, que hasta la fecha tanto en Liga Endesa como en Eurocup había comenzado a remolque del ritmo marcado por el rival en el electrónico. En esta ocasión, Kljajic y Shurna fueron los más entonados en los minutos de arranque, minimizando el protagonismo anotador de Jallow y Klepeisz (15-11 en el ecuador del periodo inicial). Con las primeras rotaciones, el Granca se veía cómodo en ataque y sólido en defensa. Un espectacular mate de Brussino a dos manos cortando la zona entre dos defensas puso a las claras el peldaño físico que estaba imponiendo el conjunto amarillo a su rival alemán, animándose a la derrama Pelos, Lammers y Bassas (28-13). El dominio isleño se tornó en sangría a partir del segundo cuarto. Bassas y Shurna sacaron a pasear su muñeca e el perímetro, mientras Happ se anclaba en la pintura para tormento de la defensa germana, estirando la ventaja hasta los 28 puntos (62-34). En la reanudación, el Gran Canaria siguió pasando el rodillo, aunque alternando los golpes en ambos aros, manteniendo los guarismos altos del primer tiempo y con las defensas erosionadas en un carrusel de faltas continuas. En esa caótica refriega, jugadores como Kljajic y Salvó, con menos minutos en las rotaciones ligueras, sacaron rédito para engordar las estadísticas, mientras Jallow y Klepeisz asumían de nuevo galones en la batería ofensiva de los visitantes (74-69). No obstante, el Ulm fue poco a poco descontando en el electrónico, hasta que un 2+1 de Figueroa, con tiro libre añadido de Núñez, acortó la desventaja hasta los 14 puntos (80-66) en la recta final del tercer cuarto. El Ratiopharm parecía revivir, aprovechando el particular cortocircuito isleño, pero tanto Albicy como Slaughter dieron un paso al frente para elevar de nuevo la hemorragia a la veintena (88-68), a falta de ocho minutos para el desenlace. A partir de ahí, el ‘Granca’ imprimió velocidad al juego, volviendo a los 28 puntos de ventaja (98-70) y forzando el tiempo muerto del técnico visitante, el exjugador ACB Anton Gavel -Polaris World Murcia-. Sin embargo, la pausa táctico apenas sirvió para frenar la herida, ya que el Dreamland siguió con su particular demolición, elevándose ya por encima de la treintena (106-74). Al final, el equipo amarillo se llevó una victoria más que balsámica ante el campeón de Alemania (111-82) que le permite ponerse con un balance de 2-0 en Europa y tomar oxígeno de cara a la Liga Endesa.

Relato. 'Él estaba con su abuela paterna, su padrino (que es el mismo abuelo paterno), estaba con su tía, su prima y con los demás familiares de la difunta. Estaban visitando a la bisabuela, que falleció el pasado 4 de octubre', recordó la progenitora. Cuando iban a salir, el niño dio tres pasos cuando ocurrió la tragedia. Una rama de los imponentes árboles que se encuentran en el cementerio cayó sobre el menor e hizo que este perdiera el equilibrio y se golpeara con una de las lápidas. 'Mi hijo iba en la mitad de ellos cuando le cayó la rama a él. Sintieron un golpe, pero creyeron que se había caído. La abuela, que iba al lado de él, bajó la mirada porque la rama le tocó el pie, y luego fue que la tía empezó a gritar: ¡El niño, el niño! Y fue cuando notaron que se pegó contra la lápida, se desnucó, y la rama le quedó incrustada en su cabecita', agregó entre lágrimas la mamá. En medio de la situación, cuentan los familiares que llamaron a una ambulancia, pero esta no llegó. El personal del cementerio también brilló por su ausencia. 'Las personas que estaban en ese momento en el cementerio, arreglando otras tumbas, fueron las que les ayudaron. Una señora les pasó unas toallas para detener la hemorragia de la cabeza y lo montaron de una en el carro', dijo Sandrid. Los familiares de Ángel lo llevaron en el carro hasta un centro médico y por el camino encontraron una ambulancia, que los socorrió. 'Mientras la señora de la ambulancia estaba vendando a mi hijo, mi cuñada le iba haciendo reanimación, pero cuando llegó al hospital de Meissen llegó sin signos vitales. No pudieron hacer nada', agregó la mamá. Hasta el momento, cuenta la familia de Ángel que no han recibido apoyo, que del cementerio llamó un trabajador de duelo, pero eso fue todo. 'Mi hijo estaba cursando segundo de primaria en el colegio Ciudad Bogotá (Tunjuelito), era un niño muy inteligente, me decía que estaba feliz por haber pasado el año. Él estaba con sus padrinos, se lo llevaron a cine a ver la película ‘Paw patrol’. Él se quedó con ellos, se la vio en la mañana del sábado y en la tarde fue cuando falleció', narró con tristeza la mamá de Ángel. Por el momento, en medio de la tristeza que los embarga, los familiares de Ángel desean que esto no le vuelva a suceder a alguien más.

El secretario de Asuntos Sociales y Familia de la Generalitat, Lluís Torrens, cree que la muerte de ocho personas entre agosto y principios de septiembre de 2022 por una intoxicación de salmonela en una residencia geriátrica de Barcelona fue algo 'muy excepcional' y ha defendido las inspecciones que llevan a cabo desde el Govern. En comisión parlamentaria este miércoles, ha asegurado que pone la mano en el fuego por los funcionarios que se encargan de realizar las inspecciones en centros residenciales y ha insistido en que, en este caso en concreto, fue la dirección quien 'ocultaba información que se tiene que transmitir'. La Fiscalía Provincial de Barcelona interpuso en julio una denuncia ante el Juzgado de Instrucción 17 de Barcelona en la que expone que en el centro se produjo 'un brote de gastroenteritis aguda por salmonela enteritidis que afectó a 39 residentes, ocasionó la hospitalización de 15 de ellos y el fallecimiento de ocho ancianos'. El fiscal concuerda con Torrens al afirmar que el administrador único y gerente de la empresa que gestiona la residencia, la directora del centro, la gobernanta y una doctora 'no notificaron ninguno de esos casos al Servicio de Epidemiología (SEPID), negaron el contagio de 33 de los residentes y no comunicaron siete de los ocho fallecimientos', y tenían obligación de hacerlo, añade. Sin embargo, el secretario de Asuntos Sociales y Familia de la Generalitat ha reconocido que es necesario 'una mayor coordinación y clarificación de las funciones inspectoras' entre Salud, Salud Pública de Barcelona y Derechos Sociales a la hora de realizar una inspección a una residencia. Hasta ahora cada una de las inspecciones actúa de forma autónoma y Torrens ha avanzado que publicarán una instrucción entre las tres 'para regular los protocolos de comunicación' entre ellas. GRUPOS.

423339131,"Пациент 10-й клинической больницы Минска, водитель-международник Дмитрий Максимов поступил в хирургическое отделение по направлению из поликлиники с холециститом. При госпитализации инфекционных симптомов у него не было, а на завтра поднялась температура до 40 градусов, усилилась головная и мышечная боль, появились другие признаки, характерные для бубонной формы чумы. Пока это лишь легенда. Но медики должны быть готовы ко всему. Об ухудшении состояния больного медсестра сообщает хирургу. Экипированный в средства индивидуальной защиты хирург подробно расспрашивает пациента о его самочувствии. Выясняются новые подробности. - Мучит тошнота, - жалуется Максимов. – Очень болит паховая область справа, особенно когда пытаюсь ходить. Доктор при осмотре обратил внимание на следы от почесов на ногах. Они появились в результате укусов - вероятно, блох. Пациент недавно был в рейсе в Казахстане, где зафиксированы инфекционные вспышки. Врач уточняет, чем питался Максимов, где ночевал. Узнаем, что отдыхал он в основном в машине и отелях, питался в заведениях общепита. - У меня есть подозрение на инфекционное заболевание, - констатирует хирург и сообщает об этом по мобильной связи заведующему отделением. Дальше по цепочке оповещения об этом узнают замглавврача и главврач, который вызывает в хирургическое отделение инфекционную бригаду с укладками для оказания экстренной медпомощи, личной профилактики и проведения дезинфекции. Санитарка перед входом в палату № 316 орошает дезинфектантом санитарную одежду хирурга, а также его руки после снятия каждого элемента защитного костюма. Врач, обследовавший Максимова, остается в санитарной комнате до направления в изолятор как контактное лицо. Инфекционист подтверждает подозрение на чуму. Эвакуационная бригада помещает пациента в бокс биологической защиты и отвозит в инфекционный стационар. Палату полностью дезинфицируют, изымают постельные принадлежности для обработки. Подобные учения Минздрав инициирует ежегодно во всех регионах. Особо опасные инфекции регистрируют во многих странах мира. Увеличение туристических потоков, природные катастрофы, военные действия представляют угрозу распространения заразы. - Проводим противоэпидемические учения в том числе по выявлению холеры, сибирской язвы, различных видов лихорадок, - подчеркивает начальник отдела гигиены, эпидемиологии и профилактики Минздрава Инна Карабан. - Учитывая, что чума зарегистрирована в Монголии, США и некоторых регионах Китая, захотели вспомнить действия при ее обнаружении. С медиками из столицы и регионов детально обсудили различные моменты. Пока для этого есть время, а вот в реальной ситуации его не будет. При подозрении на особо опасную инфекцию надо действовать сразу, убежден заведующий хирургическим отделением № 1 Александр Есепкин - По легенде в нашем отделении выявили больного чумой. Значит, мы должны максимально быстро ограничить очаг инфекции, не дать ей распространиться за пределы отделения. Для этого обязательно изолировать пациента, создать чистую и контаминированную зоны, шлюз, использовать защитные комбинезоны и другую экипировку. Составляем списки пациентов и сотрудников, которые в это время находились в отделении, и наблюдаем за ними. Алгоритм действий отработали четко, значит – сможем противостоять. В ТЕМУ Черная смерть, бушующая в Европе с 1347 по 1352 годы, стала одной из самых ужасных катастроф в истории человечества: бубонная чума унесла миллионы жизней, навсегда изменив общество и экономику многих государств. Когда чума распространилась по Европе, появилось много странных теорий на счет происхождения вируса. Бытовало мнение, что к пандемии привели скопления «плохого воздуха», которые высвободились из-под земли в результате землетрясений. Религиозные группы утверждали, что эпидемия — наказание за грехи. На самом же деле антисанитария, отсутствие гигиены и неразвитая медицина — истинные причины появления чумной палочки.

423400496,"Decisão Thiago Brennand é condenado a mais de 10 anos de prisão por estupro. Empresário foi condenado a 10 anos e seis meses de prisão por estupro de modelo americana. Nesta quarta-feira (11), o empresário Thiago Brennand, foi condenado a 10 anos e 6 meses de prisão, pelo estupro a uma modelo americana. A sentença foi proferida pelo juiz Israel Salu, que também impôs multa de R$ 50 mil a ser paga pelo empresário à vítima como indenização por danos morais — o Ministério Público requeria R$ 1 milhão como reparação de danos. A decisão está sob segredo de Justiça, mas foi obtida pelo GLOBO. Cabe recurso. Esse processo, o primeiro a ter fim que traga de crimes de que Thiago Brennand é acusado por um grupo de mulheres, trata de acusações de estupro seguido de violência física e grave ameaça feitas por uma modelo americana que namorou o empresário em 2021. A mulher relatou que o relacionamento durou três meses. Eles se conheceram quando a modelo, então casada, visitou a fazenda do empresário no intuito de comprar um cavalo. 'Começamos a sair e ele começou a me ofender, a chamar de puta, (a dizer) que eu não era de confiança, enfim, me ofendeu muitas vezes com coisas bem pesadas. Ele me ameaçava com arma, se ele me matasse ninguém saberia', disse em depoimento ao Ministério Público de São Paulo (MP-SP). De acordo com a modelo, Brennand a obrigou a fazer sexo anal contra sua vontade e a proibiu de sair de sua casa. 'Não queria fazer sexo anal, mas ele me forçou. Ele segurou minha mão e machucou meu ânus. Eu fiquei sangrando por duas semanas, os empregados trocavam a roupa de cama todos os dias por causa disso'. Brennand foi denunciado em setembro do ano passado, quando já havia deixado o Brasil para morar no Oriente Médio, e se tornou réu em 4 de novembro, data em que também teve prisão preventiva decretada nesse caso. As audiências tiveram início em 30 de maio, quando o empresário já estava encarcerado no Centro de Detenção Provisória 1 de Pinheiros, na Zona Oeste de São Paulo, para onde foi levado após ser extraditado depois de ter sido preso nos Emirados Árabes Unidos. O MP-SP relatou à Justiça que Brennand 'usualmente ameaçava' a modelo, que não era livre para romper o relacionamento que mantiveram. Para mantê-la por perto, segundo a Promotoria, o empresário dizia que havia gravado cenas íntimas da mulher a partir de câmeras escondidas em sua casa, e que já tinha vazado vídeos de outras ex-namoradas anteriormente. Durante uma viagem de carro, ainda de acordo com o MP-SP, Brennand teria ameaçado matar a então namorada e 'desová-la' na rodovia. A 'grave ameaça' apontada pela vítima teria se configurado, na visão da acusação, no fato de o empresário manter armas de fogo 'ostensivamente' no local onde as alegadas violências eram praticadas, o seu quarto no condomínio de luxo Fazenda Boa Vista (em Porto Feliz). A defesa de Brennand contestou a legalidade de diversos trâmites adotados no processo. Disse que a mulher tinha a 'pretensão de manter relacionamento firme e perene com o réu, enquanto ele desde o início teria deixado claro ter outra intenção' . Negou as agressões, contrariou as versões apresentadas pela vítima a respeito das relações sexuais que mantiveram, e afirmou que a própria modelo era responsável por limpar o quarto do casal, sendo que Brennand nunca viu qualquer mancha de sangue no local. O juiz Israel Salu considerou que os fatos apresentados pela mulher foram narrados 'de forma coesa e firme' e que demonstraram terem sido 'diversos os atos de violência e desprezo praticados pelo réu contra a vítima' . O magistrado mencionou, ao destacar o perfil violento do empresário, relatos da mãe e do pai de Brennand feitos em testamento público. Disse que Brennand demonstrou, até mesmo em seus depoimentos à Justiça, ter 'determinação' e 'até mesmo obsessão' para 'atingir os seus objetivos e realizar suas vontades'. Sobre a guerra de versões a respeito do sexo anal ter sido consentido ou não, o juiz escreveu: 'Não é demais destacar que nos crimes contra a dignidade sexual, geralmente praticados de forma oculta, a palavra da vítima ganha especial relevância, máxime quando acompanhada de elementos de informação e de provas, como na hipótese dos autos'. 'A vítima, assim, foi firme ao afirmar que a violência constituiu no fato de o réu virar-lhe de costas, segurar os seus braços e praticar o ato libidinoso com violência, inclusive causando sangramento por duas semanas; a grave ameaça diz respeito ao ambiente hostil e intimidatório utilizado pelo réu', continuou o magistrado. Em nota, os advogados que representam a vítima disseram que a mulher recebeu a notícia da decisão 'emocionada, aliviada e com serenidade'. Disseram que a sentença 'representa o fim da impunidade'. 'Confiamos na Justiça e seguimos firmes lutando pelo fim da impunidade e pelo combate à toda forma de violência contra a mulher', escreveram os advogados Marcio Cezar Janjacomo, João Vinicius Manssur e Marcelo Luis Roland Zovico. Procurada, a defesa do empresário não se manifestou até a publicação desta reportagem. Este é o terceiro processo enfrentado por Thiago Brennand a chegar a uma conclusão. Nos dois anteriores, o empresário firmou acordos com as vítimas: um garçom que o acusava por injúria em Porto Feliz e o caseiro do condomínio de luxo onde Brennand morava, que havia sido ameaçado e chamado de 'vagabundo' pelo empresário. Para este, Brennand aceitou pagar R$ 18 mil para encerrar a ação penal. O empresário, que tornou-se conhecido nacionalmente após agredir uma modelo numa academia de luxo em São Paulo, ainda responde a outras seis ações penais na Justiça. A lista é constituída por dois processos por estupro; um por estupro, sequestro e cárcere privado; dois por lesão corporal, e um por calúnia. *Com informações do O Globo.

423357850,"El Programa de Epidemiología de la provincia de San Luis, a través del Servicio de Zoonosis, alertó sobre un brote de triquinosis en el departamento Junín, en el norte de la provincia, tras la detección de 11 casos en las localidades de Bajo de Véliz y Santa Rosa del Conlara, al parecer por el consumo de chorizos caseros. El martes se notificaron vía telefónica cinco casos que, sumados a los anteriores, elevan a 11 el total. Se identificó que el brote fue por consumo de chorizos caseros de los queno se pudo identificar la procedencia. 'Se sospecha del consumo de un jabalí faenado en la localidad, y sin control bromatológico, consumido por estas personas de Bajo Véliz las cuales fueron atendidas y medicadas en Hospital de Santa Rosa del Conlara con evolución favorable', se informó oficialmente. 'Los pacientes fueron atendidos en el Hospital de Santa Rosa del Conlara, todos se encuentran bajo tratamiento y en buen estado de salud', explicaron desde el programa y agregaron que, de las entrevistas epidemiológicas realizadas, se identificó que el brote fue 'por consumo de chorizos caseros, de los que, hasta el momento, no se pudo identificar la procedencia'. 'No obstante, se sigue con la investigación en conjunto con el Área de Bromatología del Municipio de Santa Rosa del Conlara', detalló Rodrigo Verdugo, jefe del Programa Epidemiología. QUÉ ES LA TRIQUINOSIS Y CÓMO PREVENIRLA. La triquinosis es una zoonosis producida por un parásito con forma de gusano (Trichinella spiralis) que se aloja en los músculos de los cerdos y otros animales silvestres, como el jabalí y el puma. Se transmite principalmente por la ingesta de carne de cerdo cruda o mal cocida, contaminada con el parásito. Las manifestaciones clínicas son muy variables y pueden cursar como una infección inadvertida o presentar síntomas que, por lo general, comienzan con fiebre, dolor muscular intenso, dolor de cabeza y dolor e hinchazón alrededor de los ojos. También pueden aparecer signos gastrointestinales como diarrea y vómitos y ante la presencia de síntomas, se solicita concurrir inmediatamente a un centro de salud, e informar sobre el consumo de este tipo de productos. Para prevenir esta enfermedad se recomienda no consumir ni permitir el consumo de carnes crudas y/o chacinados caseros que no hayan sido inspeccionados previamente a la elaboración. Verificar el rótulo o etiqueta de fabricación en todos los subproductos de cerdo que se adquieran donde deberá leerse claramente la marca del producto; empresa responsable; número de habilitación nacional del establecimiento; fecha de elaboración y de vencimiento del producto; condición de mantenimiento en cuanto a temperaturas ambientales; y rótulo con la composición del producto.

423402093,"A Prefeitura de Manaus, via Centro de Cooperação da Cidade (CCC), torna público que, por consequência da fumaça que voltou a encobrir o município de Manaus, foi necessário realizar a alteração do status da capital para “Mobilização”, nesta quarta-feira, 11/10. A alteração foi analisada por especialistas de saúde e meio ambiente das Secretarias Municipais de Saúde (Semsa); e de Meio Ambiente e Sustentabilidade (Semmas), devido à fumaça proveniente das queimadas. Como esclarece o superintendente do CCC, Sandro Diz, o estágio de Mobilização é classificado como o segundo nível, em uma escala de cinco, e significa que há riscos de ocorrências de alto impacto na cidade devido a um evento previsto ou a partir da análise de dados provenientes de especialistas. “A decisão foi alinhada, em conjunto com a Semsa e a Semmas, com o objetivo de padronizar e agilizar a comunicação sobre os reflexos dos diversos tipos de ações que a Prefeitura de Manaus está realizando para acolher e orientar à população sobre as queimadas, que são prejudiciais tanto ao meio ambiente quanto à saúde humana”, afirmou o superintendente. Recomendações de Saúde. Para evitar problemas de saúde relacionados à exposição à fumaça, a Semsa recomenda que medidas de proteção simples sejam adotadas na rotina das famílias. A proteção individual pode ser feita especialmente com o uso de máscaras, hidratação oral, com o consumo reforçado de líquidos, principalmente água, e a lavagem dos olhos e do nariz, usando-se soro fisiológico para evitar o ressecamento e o agravamento de quadros de irritação. No ambiente doméstico, é importante o uso de umidificadores, vaporizadores ou de uma bacia com água para deixar os cômodos mais úmidos. “Estamos em um cenário atípico e é importante que todos adotem alguns cuidados, com atenção especial às crianças, aos idosos e aos que são mais sensíveis às condições climáticas, como as pessoas que têm rinites alérgicas e asma, por exemplo”, alerta a titular da Semsa, Shádia Fraxe, destacando que a exposição à fumaça pode causar desde desconfortos leves e passageiros a sintomas como dor de cabeça e dor de garganta, dificuldade respiratória, lacrimejamento e vermelhidão nos olhos e crises alérgicas. A secretária recomenda que, além das medidas de proteção respiratória mais comuns, é importante que, dentro do possível, as pessoas evitem aglomerações, circular em áreas próximas a queimadas e sair no horário de maior calor, desde o final da manhã até o meio da tarde. Nos casos de agravamento de sintomas, principalmente dificuldade para respirar (falta de ar), a pessoa deve procurar uma unidade de saúde de pronto atendimento. “Estamos em um cenário atípico e é importante que todos adotem alguns cuidados, com atenção especial às crianças, aos idosos e aos que são mais sensíveis às condições climáticas, como as pessoas que têm rinites alérgicas e asma, por exemplo”, alerta a titular da Semsa, Shádia Fraxe, destacando que a exposição à fumaça pode causar desde desconfortos leves e passageiros a sintomas como dor de cabeça e dor de garganta, dificuldade respiratória, lacrimejamento e vermelhidão nos olhos e crises alérgicas. Dados. De acordo com dados do programa Queimadas, do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Inpe) e que foram levantados pela Prefeitura de Manaus, via Semmas, as queimadas têm origem nos municípios da Região Metropolitana de Manaus (RMM). Nos últimos dois dias, conforme dados do Inpe, foram registrados 504 focos de queimadas no Amazonas, sendo que o município de Autazes, a 111 quilômetros de Manaus, registrou 105, o que representa 20,8% do total registrado no Amazonas. Além de Autazes, os municípios de Careiro (50 focos), Careiro da Várzea (26 focos), Itacoatiara (24 focos) e Manacapuru (18) estão entre os dez municípios que mais registraram focos de queimadas nos últimos dois dias, segundo os dados do Inpe. Manaus, neste mesmo período, registrou três focos de queimadas, todos na zona rural, sendo dois nas proximidades da BR-174, rodovia que liga o Roraima e Amazonas, e o terceiro foi registrado nas proximidades da comunidade Nossa Senhora de Nazaré, no rio Amazonas. Denúncias. De 1 a 10 de outubro, a Semmas recebeu 14 denúncias de queimadas dentro do período urbano de Manaus. A secretaria passou todos os registros para os órgãos de Segurança Pública do Estado com o objetivo de identificar os autores.

423356500,"Rio - Os deputados estaduais Rodrigo Amorim (PTB), Alan Lopes (PL), e Filippe Poubel (PL) se envolveram em uma confusão com guardas municipais, agentes da Secretaria de Ordem Pública (Seop) e policiais militares durante uma fiscalização na Avenida Brasil na noite desta terça-feira (10). Em vídeos divulgados nas redes sociais, os parlamentares aparecem enfrentando os agentes públicos de forma agressiva. Ainda nas imagens, Rodrigo Amorim chega a empurrar um guarda municipal e faz gestos como se fosse iniciar uma luta corporal. 'Seja homem, você tá cheio de marra, tira o dedo da minha cara o car***. Vem então', diz o deputado em um determinado momento do vídeo. Seguranças armados também aparecem na confusão. De acordo com a Seop, agentes do programa BRT Seguro realizavam uma operação de rotina para coibir o trânsito de veículos na via exclusiva de ônibus na Avenida Brasil, quando foram abordados pelos deputados estaduais tentando impedir o trabalho de fiscalização. O caso foi registrado pelos agentes na 22DP (Penha). Em nota, a Secretaria Municipal de Ordem Pública (Seop) disse, ainda, que repudia a ação dos deputados estaduais que abusaram da sua autoridade para impedir o trabalho de fiscalização do BRT Seguro, coagindo e ameaçando os servidores públicos. Nas redes sociais, a Polícia Militar divulgou um comunicado de repúdio. 'Lamentamos profundamente os fatos ocorridos na noite de hoje na Avenida Brasil, onde profissionais da área de segurança pública foram desrespeitados e humilhados, quando exerciam suas atividades legais', disse a nota. O que dizem os deputados Procurados pela reportagem, os deputados responderam com uma nota conjunta através da Comissão Especial de Combate à Desordem Urbana da Alerj, da qual fazem parte. Eles alegam que foram checar denúncias de que uma blitz estaria praticando ilegalidades e desrespeitando cidadãos. 'Ao chegar ao local, na pista central da Avenida Brasil, foi constatado que veículos regularizados, com toda a documentação em dia, estavam sendo removidos aos pátios públicos por terem transitado na via exclusiva para veículos de transporte coletivo. Trata-se de uma infração passível de solução imediata, visto que o Código Brasileiro de Trânsito prevê que o veículo seja apenas autuado, ao contrário do que se encontrou no local', disse um trecho da nota. Os deputados ainda argumentaram que 'no local foram surpreendidos com uma idosa recém-operada, que estava passando mal, com sangramento, e ainda assim teve seu veículo colocado no reboque de maneira irregular, com a documentação rigorosamente em dia'. 'A idosa estava há mais de duas horas com seu carro no reboque pedindo socorro aos agentes públicos, sem qualquer retorno. Os deputados prontamente acionaram o Corpo de Bombeiros, que rapidamente chegaram ao local e prestaram o devido atendimento, levando-a para a UPA da Penha', acrescenta o comunicado. Eles disseram, ainda, que Polícia Civil será devidamente comunicada da situação abusiva praticada contra a idosa. Sobre o empurrão realizado pelo deputado Rodrigo Amorim, a assessoria explicou que ele repreendeu um policial militar pela omissão de socorro, cena que foi recortada sem dar o delicado contexto completo. 'Durante a retirada dos veículos que estavam sobre os reboques, de maneira irregular e ilegal, os guardas municipais se juntaram para impedir a saída dos cidadãos, um deles ameaçou o deputado Rodrigo Amorim com um taser, que se defendeu afastando-o com um empurrão', diz o comunicado. A assessoria disse ainda que os parlamentares são favoráveis às operações dentro da legalidade e se mantêm 'impreterivelmente em defesa dos agentes de segurança pública que honram suas fardas'. Alan Lopes é presidente da Comissão Especial de Combate à Desordem Urbana da Alerj, enquanto Amorim atua como vice-presidente. Já Filippe Poubel é membro titular. Procurada, a Alerj ainda não se manifestou sobre o caso. O espaço segue aberto para posicionamento. A Polícia Civil também não deu detalhes sobre as investigações. A Avenida Brasil voltou a ter uma faixa seletiva exclusiva para ônibus nos dois sentidos, entre os bairros Guadalupe e Caju, no último sábado (7).

423391665,"Na avaliação da defesa, a sentença foi 'fundamentada apenas na palavra da vítima'. Para os advogados do empresário, a decisão foi 'completamente dissociada de todos os elementos de prova colhidos durante a instrução, os quais demonstraram de forma cristalina que o acusado nunca praticou violência sexual. Os advogados afirmam que a sentença se baseou 'em uma versão de um personagem criado'. 'Preferiu o magistrado trilhar o caminho mais fácil de julgar com base na pessoa e não nos fatos.' A defesa afirmou ainda que 'tem total confiança no Poder Judiciário para corrigir essa injusta condenação.' A condenação não altera o local em que o empresário cumpre pena, segundo a Secretaria de Administração Penitenciária (SAP) de São Paulo. 'Como o processo no qual foi condenado ainda não transitou em julgado, ele continua na prática como provisório', informou a assessoria de imprensa da pasta. Primeira condenação. Brennand foi condenado ao cumprimento da pena de 10 anos e seis meses de reclusão, a ser cumprido inicialmente no regime fechado, pelo crime de estupro. Segundo o Tribunal de Justiça de São Paulo (TJ-SP), cabe recurso. Ele também terá de indenizar a vítima por danos morais sofridos, no valor mínimo de R$ 50.000,00 , de acordo com o TJ-SP.

Brennand está preso preventivamente no CDP (Centro de Detenção Provisória) 1 de Pinheiros, em São Paulo, desde o final de abril, quando foi extraditado dos Emirados Árabes. Ele está em uma cela isolada dos demais presos, conhecida como 'seguro', quando o preso corre algum tipo de risco à vida e pede proteção. O crime de estupro está previsto no artigo 213 do Código Penal Brasileiro segundo a legislação, é estupro 'constranger alguém, mediante violência ou grave ameaça, a ter conjunção carnal ou a praticar ou permitir que com ele se pratique outro ato libidinoso'. Relembre o caso. A 'A gente saía junto há um mês, mas nunca quis nada sério com ele porque os apetites sexuais [dele] eram diferentes do que eu concordava', disse.

423351198,"Dopo l'invito ai cittadini del sindaco di Cetara a non somministrare cibo ai gatti randagi per 'evitare problematiche dal punto di vista igienico-sanitarie', scoppia la polemica nella città della Costiera. Il Sindaco Fortunato Della Monica ha voluto replicare all'ENPA dopo le dichiarazioni del presidente in merito al manifesto che invitava i cittadini ' a non lasciare cibo per terra lungo le strade di Cetara o sotto i bidoni della spazzatura'. 'I residui di cibo - si legge nel cartellone - attraggono topi e insetti infestanti, creando una preoccupazione ulteriore di allarme sanitario. inerente i gatti randagi'. Il Primo cittadino, diffidato a togliere i manifesti, ha voluto specificare che l'intento degli stessi non era quello di affamare i gatti, ma di chiedere ai residenti di non lasciare il cibo in strada, al fine di evitare problematiche dal punto di vista sanitario. La nota del primo cittadino. Dalla gogna mediatica che ci ha travolto in questi giorni, abbiamo imparato che i social possono diventare occasione di sfogo incontrollato di malcontenti e odi repressi tendenzialmente idonei a travalicare i limiti del diritto di critica. Inoltre, molto spesso le persone si fermano al titolo o alla singola parola fraintendendo, e talvolta stravolgendo, il significato reale dell'intero testo. Ciò premesso, il manifesto contestato non è un divieto né tantomeno un'ordinanza sindacale, è semplicemente un invito in questo precipuo frangente per prevenire un'eventuale allerta sanitaria, determinata dalla presenza di agenti infestanti (topi, blatte, ecc.) attirati dal cibo lasciato per strada. L'invito non è quello di affamare i gatti, bensì, in questo periodo, quello di fornire loro il cibo presso la propria abitazione, al fine di garantire la pulizia dei residui e mantenere buone condizioni igienico-sanitarie. Il problema del paese in questo momento non è il randagismo, è l'igiene urbana, perché tante persone (pur in buona fede) tengono comportamenti assolutamente errati, anche per la stessa salute degli animali, lasciando per strada ogni genere di alimento e residuo alimentare domestico, così che gli animali rilasciano vomito ed escrementi liquidi e maleodoranti. Inoltre, spesso lasciano a terra buste, piatti di plastica, contenitori di ogni tipo, addirittura lenzuola, contro ogni norma di decoro urbano e buon senso. Gli operatori ecologici tutti i giorni passano a ripulire i vicoli, ma nei caratteristici e irti vicoletti costieri certamente non c'è la possibilità di installare pompe idranti per un lavaggio e una sanificazione giornalieri.

423352713,"This study investigated the effects of Moringa oleifera polysaccharide on growth performance indicators, serum biochemical indicators, immune organ indicators, colonic morphology, colonic microbiomics and colonic transcriptomics in newborn calves. 21 newborn calves were randomly divided into three groups of 7 calves per treatment group: control group (no Moringa oleifera polysaccharide addition); low-dose group ( Moringa oleifera polysaccharide 0.5 g/kg); and high-dose group ( Moringa oleifera polysaccharide 1 g/kg). This trial used gavage to feed MOP to calves. The test lasted 8 weeks. Calves were humanely electroshocked on the last day of the trial and slaughtered afterwards. Thymus, spleen, blood and colonic contents were collected for further testing. The results of this trial showed that MOP significantly increased the body weight of newborn calves and reduced the rate of calf diarrhea, thus promoting calf growth. Fecal scores showed a linear decrease with the addition of MOP. In terms of serum biochemistry, feeding MOP significantly increased serum ALB levels in a linear fashion. In terms of serum antioxidants, feeding MOP linearly increased CAT and T-AOC levels and decreased MDA concentrations, and in terms of serum immunity, feeding MOP linearly increased IgA, IgG, and IgM levels. At the same time, MOP regulated the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the intestinal tract of calves, which reduced the occurrence of diarrhea. In addition, moringa polysaccharide could regulate genes related to inflammatory signaling pathways such as MAPK signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway in calves' intestine to reduce the occurrence of intestinal inflammation. In conclusion, MOP can be used as a novel ruminant additive for the prevention of enteritis in calves.",9578,study investigate effect moringa oleifera polysaccharide growth performance indicator serum biochemical indicator immune organ indicator colonic morphology colonic microbiomic colonic transcriptomic newborn calf newborn calf randomly divide group calf treatment group control group moringa oleifera polysaccharide addition low dose group moringa oleifera polysaccharide g kg high dose group moringa oleifera polysaccharide g kg trial gavage feed mop calf test last week calf humanely electroshocke day trial slaughter thymus spleen blood colonic content collect testing result trial show mop significantly increase body weight newborn calf reduce rate calf diarrhea promote calf growth fecal score show linear decrease addition mop term serum biochemistry feed mop significantly increase serum alb level linear fashion term serum antioxidant feed mop linearly increase cat t aoc level decrease mda concentration term serum immunity feed mop linearly increase iga igg igm level time mop regulate abundance firmicutes bacteroidetes intestinal tract calf reduce occurrence diarrhea addition moringa polysaccharide regulate gene relate inflammatory signaling pathway mapk signal pathway tgf beta signal pathway akt signal pathway tnf signal pathway calf intestine reduce occurrence intestinal inflammation conclusion mop novel ruminant additive prevention enteritis calf
423361228,"'They are sweet,' Elle suggests. 'They don’t shed, they’re just the best.' According to Pet MD, Havanese are great dogs for families and attach to humans quickly. However, they can be a little needy and get separation anxiety if left alone for too long. The next is the Bernese mountain dog which Elle describes as 'floofy and goofy, gentle and loveable.' Pet MD rates the, as great family pets, but noted they are predisposed to some health issues, saying owners may have to look out for gut, hip and elbow conditions, as well as some cancers which they are prone too. Next comes a Portuguese water dog, which are known as being spirited, athletic, and intelligent. 'They're very good family dogs,' she explains. 'They're very sweet, they're very smart.' Elle's next recommendation is a springer spaniel. Elle says that the pooches are 'trainable, incredibly loyal, [and] just great dogs – I love them.' Lastly, she went to share her to pick of the bunch - rescue dogs. 'Some of the best dogs on this planet are ones that have been given a second chance at life,' she explained. 'They love their owners so unconditionally, and I highly, highly recommend you adopt a rescue dog,' she urged. TikTok viewers weighed in with their thoughts about the breeds. 'Love my rescue doggies. Thanks for putting them on your list!' one user responded enthusiastically. 'I was skeptical until you got to number one,' gushed another. 'My aunt has two Havanese. One of them is scared of everything and they’re both VERY barky,' replied another dubious TikTok user. Elle has previously revealed the five dog breeds she would never own. TikTok users weighed in on Elle's recommendations, many saying they love their rescue dogs and wouldn't have it any other way. 'Coming in at number five, we have the husky. They are escape artists. Unless you are willing to run for seven miles a day with your dog – and that won't even tire them out – do not own a husky.' Number four on the list is the 'good old chihuahua', 99 per cent of which are 'demons' according to the veterinary expert. Her third dog to avoid owning is 'any brachycephalic pets out there' – which means any breeds with short-noses or flat-faces like the pug, French bulldog or Boston terrier. She said: 'They literally cannot breathe, they cannot breathe and they get a lot of skin issues, but they are very sweet dogs.' Number two on Elle's countdown is one of the most distinctive breeds, the Great Dane. She said: 'Listen, they are gentle giants, but they have incredibly sensitive stomachs and that dog will have diarrhea on your carpet at 3am and it will be bigger than if a horse went.' Lastly Elle revealed that the number one dog to avoid is the Belgian Malinois.

423356560,"A litter of flea-ridden puppies which were found starving and abandoned in a bush are receiving care in the hopes of being re-homed. Yesterday, at around 6.45pm, Medivet care in Egremont Road, Bearsted , was visited by a woman with a box full of the furry siblings. The puppies were handed over in a cardboard box. Picture: Medivet. She found the four spaniel puppies – estimated to be between six to eight weeks old – in a bush behind Maidstone Boxing Club in Park Wood. Nurses were told how one had come running out towards her before returning to where it came from. When she followed it into the bush that’s when she heard and saw the rest of the pups. Upon handing them over to student nurses Phoebe Mallion and Amelia Maynard, the condition the dogs had been left in was clear to see. Amelia explained: 'They were quite stressed and petrified. 'I can’t imagine how long they were there for but if the lady didn’t bring them in who knows what could’ve happened to them. The puppies are being well looked after at the vets. Picture: Medivet. 'They may have been eaten by foxes or could have frozen or starved.' The pair cared for them an hour past closing time, making sure they were fed and watered before leaving them overnight in the kennels. This morning the dogs have been treated for fleas and having tests for diseases like parvo. The practice’s head nurse Mia Pring said: 'They were covered in fleas, malnourished and are having diarrhea. 'They all have umbilical hernias as well which doesn’t cause them discomfort and can be easily rectified with surgery but this could be why they were dumped as most breeders wouldn’t deal with the problem. From the left: Head nurse, Mia Pring, Student nurses Jess Harris, Phoebe Mallion, and Amelia Maynard holding the four abandoned puppies. Picture: Medivet. 'The plan is now to call the dog warden who will hold them until they can be placed in a rescue.' It is a legal requirement for dogs without a microchip to be housed by a dog warden for seven days. In that time an owner can come forward and reclaim their animal but once the time has elapsed, they have legally released all ownership of that animal. The staff at the vets feel there is no indication the owner is worried about these puppies. Phoebe said: 'It’s frustrating people do these things. The four spaniel puppies sleeping. Picture: Medivet. 'If you don’t want or can’t look after your pet, hand them over to a vet or a rescue don’t just dump them to die.' Despite all they’ve been through the staff are optimistic for the puppies’ future. Phoebe continued: 'We are obsessed by them. Everyone keeps coming over to take pictures. 'I’m sure once they are in a rescue, they will find new homes in no time.' Though the vet cannot directly help in re-homing the animals, it is calling for anyone with information about them to get in touch on 01622 736677.

Riceviamo e pubblichiamo il comunicato stampa inoltratoci dal Sindaco di Cetara Fortunato Della Monica , che ha voluto replicare all'ENPA dopo le dichiarazioni del presidente in merito al manifesto inerente i gatti randagi. Il Primo cittadino, diffidato a togliere i manifesti, ha voluto specificare che l'intento degli stessi non era quello di affamare i gatti, ma di chiedere ai residenti di non lasciare il cibo in strada, perché attrae topi e insetti infestanti, bensì di metterlo a disposizione degli animali in casa propria. Di seguito il testo integrale. Dalla gogna mediatica che ci ha travolto in questi giorni, abbiamo imparato che i social possono diventare occasione di sfogo incontrollato di malcontenti e odi repressi tendenzialmente idonei a travalicare i limiti del diritto di critica. Inoltre, molto spesso le persone si fermano al titolo o alla singola parola fraintendendo, e talvolta stravolgendo, il significato reale dell'intero testo. Ciò premesso, il manifesto contestato non è un divieto né tantomeno un'ordinanza sindacale, è semplicemente un invito in questo precipuo frangente per prevenire un'eventuale allerta sanitaria, determinata dalla presenza di agenti infestanti (topi, blatte, ecc.) attirati dal cibo lasciato per strada. L'invito non è quello di affamare i gatti, bensì, in questo periodo, quello di fornire loro il cibo presso la propria abitazione, al fine di garantire la pulizia dei residui e mantenere buone condizioni igienico-sanitarie. Il problema del paese in questo momento non è il randagismo, è l'igiene urbana, perché tante persone (pur in buona fede) tengono comportamenti assolutamente errati, anche per la stessa salute degli animali, lasciando per strada ogni genere di alimento e residuo alimentare domestico, così che gli animali rilasciano vomito ed escrementi liquidi e maleodoranti. Inoltre, spesso lasciano a terra buste, piatti di plastica, contenitori di ogni tipo, addirittura lenzuola, contro ogni norma di decoro urbano e buon senso. Gli operatori ecologici tutti i giorni passano a ripulire i vicoli, ma nei caratteristici e irti vicoletti costieri certamente non c'è la possibilità di installare pompe idranti per un lavaggio e una sanificazione giornalieri. Il Comune già da tempo aveva contattato il servizio veterinario dell'Asl che ha avviato un piano di sterilizzazione. Per quanto riguarda le offese, le ingiurie e gli epiteti denigratori ricevuti e registrati, qualora tali comportamenti divenissero lesivi, verranno valutate tutte le azioni necessarie, anche giudiziarie, a tutela dell'immagine dell'Ente oltre che dei singoli amministratori coinvolti!

423382688,"O governador Rafael Fonteles visitou, nesta quarta-feira (11), a primeira unidade pública especializada no tratamento de pacientes vítimas de acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) tipo III do estado, sediada no Hospital Getúlio Vargas (HGV), em Teresina. Na oportunidade, o gestor anunciou, ainda, uma nova unidade para casos de infarto agudo do miocárdio (IAM). A unidade de AVC, instalada no mês de junho, no maior hospital público do Piauí, conta com 10 leitos e uma equipe especializada composta por neurologistas, clínicos gerais, médicos endovasculares, enfermeiras, fisioterapeutas e fonoaudiólogos. O grande objetivo da unidade é prestar um atendimento mais eficaz e rápido aos acometidos pelo AVC, doença com maior índice de mortalidade no Brasil e no Piauí. Desde junho, cerca de 80 pacientes já passaram pela unidade, sendo 18 deles somente nos primeiros 11 dias de outubro, mês em que os atendimentos foram acelerados. Durante a visita, o governador anunciou a instalação de uma nova unidade no HGV, ainda neste ano, específica para casos de infarto. 'Teremos, em breve, uma nova unidade, semelhante a essa que estamos visitando, mas específica para casos de infarto agudo do miocárdio. Então, estamos felizes em ver o HGV e o nosso sistema como um todo de hospitais estaduais progredindo de maneira eficiente, focado, especialmente, nas principais causas de morte ou de sequelas da nossa população', frisou Rafael Fonteles. Rafael Fonteles destacou a importância da unidade no salvamento de pacientes acometidos pelo AVC, especialmente aqueles de casos mais complexos e de alta gravidade. 'Temos, agora, uma unidade integrada com os hospitais do interior por meio da telemedicina, com o Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência (Samu) estadual e municipal e com as unidades de pronto atendimento. Com isso, temos prestado um atendimento melhor e mais rápido, conseguindo evitar sequelas e salvando muitas vidas', disse o gestor. O governador ressaltou, ainda, que as Linhas de Cuidados do AVC e do Infarto Agudo do Miocárdio (IAM) já foram implementadas em 16 unidades de saúde do Piauí, como forma de interiorizar essas ações. 'Essas unidade hospitalares contam com grande capacidade técnica e de insumos para prestar o melhor atendimento possível. Temos, ainda, o auxílio da telemedicina com especialistas disponíveis nos sete dias da semana e 24 horas por dia', pontuou o gestor. O secretário de Estado da Saúde, Antonio Luiz, explicou que, a partir das Linhas de Cuidados implementadas nos hospitais regionais, mais de 1.200 pacientes já haviam sido atendidos no Piauí. No entanto, o gestor apontou que faltava uma unidade mais completa e para atendimentos mais complexos. 'Sabendo dessa necessidade que tínhamos, implantamos essa unidade dentro do HGV. Agora, contamos com atendimento de altíssima qualidade, 24h ao dia e de forma sequencial, como forma de evitar agravamentos ou novos episódios, além, claro, de salvar vidas', explicou o gestor. A diretora-geral do HGV, Nirvania Carvalho, exaltou os resultados obtidos nos primeiros meses de funcionamento da unidade. 'Recentemente, percebemos um grande aumento no número de atendimentos, a qual relacionamos às várias campanhas que nós do hospital e da Secretaria de Estado da Saúde (Sesapi) fizemos. A partir delas, a população conheceu o serviço e entendeu a real necessidade de buscar atendimento imediato em caso de fortes sintomas. Então, nesses quatro meses de atuação, temos salvado cada vez mais vidas', disse a diretora. Uma das pessoas beneficiadas com a nova unidade foi Gilberto Castro, aposentado de 67 anos, que recebeu os cuidados necessários no HGV logo após ser transferido vindo do Hospital de Urgência de Teresina (HUT). 'Eu acordei e não estava sentindo as pernas e com dificuldades para falar. Minha esposa chamou imediatamente o Samu, que me levou ao HUT e logo me transferiram para cá. Agora, estou bem. Agradeço à equipe do HGV que me atendeu rapidamente', finalizou o paciente. Atenção aos sintomas. Segundo o Ministério da Saúde, existem alguns sinais que o corpo dá que ajudam a reconhecer um Acidente Vascular Cerebral. Os principais sinais de alerta para qualquer tipo de AVC são: fraqueza ou formigamento na face, no braço ou na perna, especialmente em um lado do corpo; confusão mental; alteração da fala ou compreensão, na visão, no equilíbrio, coordenação, tontura ou alteração no andar; dor de cabeça súbita, intensa, sem causa aparente. Ainda segundo o ministério, alguns sintomas indicam o infarto agudo do miocárdio, como dor ou desconforto na região peitoral, podendo irradiar para as costas, rosto, braço esquerdo e, raramente, braço direito. Essa dor costuma ser intensa e prolongada, acompanhada de sensação de peso ou aperto sobre o tórax, provocando suor frio, palidez, falta de ar e sensação de desmaio. Em ambos os casos, o Ministério da Saúde afirma que é fundamental ligar para o Samu (192), Bombeiros (193) ou levar a pessoa imediatamente a um hospital para avaliação clínica detalhada.

423382802,"O número de mortes por Acidente Vascular Cerebral no mundo pode aumentar em até 50% e chegar a 10 milhões de casos até 2050, alerta um estudo feito pela Organização Mundial do AVC. O maior número de casos será em países com renda baixa e média, grupo do qual o Brasil faz parte. Em entrevista ao Jornal Novabrasil, Eli Faria Evaristo, neurocirurgião e gerente médico do Protocolo de Atendimento ao AVC do Hospital Sirio Libanês-SP, alertou que esse é um problema que pode ser prevenido e é necessário mais políticas públicas nesse sentido: “Sem dúvida, esse é o grande esforço que o mundo inteiro, as instituições relacionadas a questão de neurologia têm lutado atualmente. É preciso reconhecer os fatores de risco, ter acesso aos tratamentos e remédios, ser monitorado periodicamente. Seria altamente impactante tratar esses fatores. Essas prevenções podem diminuir em até 90% os casos de AVC.” Ele explica que o AVC é uma condição na qual existe uma lesão do cérebro por causa de um problema circulatório, seja ele falta de circulação, seja ele hemorragia. A manifestação pode se dar através de condições genéticas ou comportamentais: “As causas são ambas, mas predomina as questões comportamentais. Questões de saúde poderiam ser melhor controladas e, com isso, teria uma intensa redução dos casos de AVC no mundo. Existem estudos mostrando que se fossem controladas 10 condições médicas, os casos de AVC reduziriam em até 90%. A maior parte dos acidentes são relacionados a questões que podemos de alguma maneira melhorar.”, revela o médico. A principal causa do acidente vascular é a pressão alta, mas outros fatores como o fumo, diabetes, aumento do colesterol, obesidade, sedentarismo e problemas cardíacos também podem impulsionar o quadro. O especialista também conta que os sintomas dependem do lugar do cérebro em que aquele problema circulatório aconteceu. Os locais mais comuns de alteração no cérebro costumam causar aliterações de movimento, desta forma a pessoa tem alguma paralisia ou alteração no corpo. Os sintomas mais marcantes e frequentes são o desiquilíbrio, a perda de visão e fala.

423366155,"By Hallie Levine. Tal vez todavía estés congestionado por un resfriado que tuviste hace un mes. O tienes la cabeza y la nariz como si estuvieran llenas de algodón, incluso después de las alergias del otoño. Quizás ni siquiera estés seguro de cuál es la causa de tus problemas de sinusitis. Además de las infecciones respiratorias y las alergias, los irritantes del medio ambiente pueden desencadenar la sinusitis. Y a veces la causa es un misterio. Pero los problemas de la sinusitis, como el goteo o la congestión nasal y los estornudos, son ciertamente frecuentes. Otros problemas pueden ser la presión nasal, la disminución del sentido del olfato, la formación de costras en la nariz y la sensación de tener que carraspear a menudo. Y los adultos mayores son más susceptibles a los problemas con estas cavidades llenas de aire detrás de la nariz, los pómulos y la frente. 'Tu nariz cambia a medida que envejeces', dice el doctor Kevin Hur, profesor de otorrinolaringología en Keck Medicine de la USC en los Ángeles. Con la edad, la nariz pierde eficacia a la hora de expulsar la mucosidad, la cual queda atrapada en los senos nasales y permite que persistan la congestión y otros síntomas desagradables. A continuación, algunos factores comunes que son culpables de la sinusitis y cómo tratarlos. Enfermedades respiratorias y alergias. Se calcula que hasta el 30% de los adultos sufren congestión o goteo nasal debido a alergias a sustancias como el polen de los árboles, la hierba o las malas hierbas como el moho, los animales domésticos, los ácaros del polvo y las cucarachas, dice el doctor alergólogo, Zachary Rubin, portavoz del Colegio Americano de Alergia, Asma e Inmunología. Además, los adultos mayores suelen tener un sistema inmunitario menos robusto, lo que los hace más propensos a los resfriados y la gripe, dice el doctor Hiten Patel, especialista en medicina familiar del Centro Médico Wexner de la Universidad Estatal de Ohio, en Columbus. Ambos pueden causar problemas sinusales. Qué hacer: Las gotas nasales salinas o los enjuagues salinos de venta libre son la mejor opción en ambos casos, dice Hur. Cuando estés congestionado, úsalos varias veces al día para ayudar a eliminar la mucosidad. 'Es como ducharse: no se puede hacer demasiadas veces', dice. Incluso puedes hacerlo de forma preventiva, por ejemplo, una o dos veces al día durante la temporada de resfriados y gripe. 'Ayuda a mantenerlos (los senos nasales) húmedos y sanos, y puede ayudar a eliminar cualquier virus que pueda causar un resfriado'. Para un virus respiratorio que está causando problemas sinusales, también puedes utilizar un aerosol nasal con esteroides de venta libre como la fluticasona (Flonase) o triamcinolona (Nasacort) durante un par de semanas. Esto puede ayudar a reducir la inflamación nasal causada por el virus, dice Hur. Para las alergias, un aerosol nasal antihistamínico de venta libre como la azelastina (Astelin o Astepro) es una mejor opción, dice Rubin, y puede aliviar rápidamente la congestión. Si esto no ayuda, pregunta a tu médico acerca de la prescripción Dymista, que combina un antihistamínico nasal con un esteroide. En ambos casos, un descongestionante nasal de venta libre en aerosol, como la oximetazolina (Afrin), puede proporcionar cierto alivio. Pero su uso durante más de tres días aumenta el riesgo de congestión de rebote, dice Hur. Y ten cuidado con los descongestionantes orales, que pueden tener ingredientes como la fenilefrina que puede elevar la presión arterial, dice Patel. Si las estrategias anteriores no ayudan después de unos 10 días de una infección respiratoria, o si empiezas a sentirte mejor y luego empeoras, considera la posibilidad de que tu médico compruebe si tienes una infección bacteriana de los senos nasales, especialmente si también tienes dolor y presión facial, tos y fiebre baja. Es posible que necesites un antibiótico, dice Hur. Para los síntomas persistentes relacionados con la alergia sinusal, pregunta acerca de la inmunoterapia (administrada en forma de inyecciones o, para algunos alérgenos, por vía sublingual). Cuando la causa no es tan clara. La rinitis no alérgica, provocada por irritantes como el humo del tabaco o de la chimenea, el humo del tráfico, los olores fuertes y los cambios de clima, también puede causar problemas sinusales. 'Se debe a una desregulación de los nervios de la nariz que producen mucosidad', dice Hur. La congestión nasal acompañada de sequedad y costras en la nariz, o incluso las hemorragias nasales, pueden indicar lo que se denomina rinitis atrófica. 'Con la edad, el tejido nasal se adelgaza y se atrofia, debido a la disminución del flujo sanguíneo a la cavidad nasal', dice el doctor Peter Manes, otorrinolaringólogo de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Yale en New Haven, Connecticut. 'El cartílago también se debilita, lo que puede cambiar la forma de la nariz'. Qué hacer: Si sospechas que puedes padecer rinitis no alérgica, evita los posibles desencadenantes y utiliza un aerosol nasal salino varias veces al día para eliminar la mucosidad y los irritantes. Necesitas más ayuda? El aerosol nasal de venta con receta ipratropio (Atrovent), que reduce la cantidad de mucosidad que produces, es útil para una nariz que moquea principalmente, dice Manes. Para la congestión nasal, los aerosoles nasales antihistamínicos suelen ser bastante eficaces. 'Lo más probable es que sea porque tienen algún tipo de efecto antiinflamatorio, y también pueden calmar las terminaciones nerviosas de la nariz', dice Manes. El tratamiento de la rinitis atrófica suele consistir en rociar frecuentemente la nariz con un aerosol nasal salino. Problemas de sinusitis que no desaparecen? Si no te sientes mucho mejor al cabo de unas semanas después de probar algunos de los tratamientos anteriores, puede ser útil que un otorrinolaringólogo te examine la nariz con un endoscopio. 'Esto nos permite detectar mucosidad que podría indicar una infección, así como inflamación o incluso pólipos nasales, crecimientos benignos en el revestimiento de las fosas nasales', dice el doctor Gregory Levitin, otorrinolaringólogo del New York Eye and Ear Infirmary de Mount Sinai en Nueva York. A veces, la solución es sencilla. En el caso de los pólipos nasales, por ejemplo, el fármaco inyectable dupilumab (Dupixent) puede ayudar a reducir su tamaño. Pero si la causa de los síntomas nasales persistentes no es clara, es posible que necesites una tomografía computarizada de los senos nasales. 'A veces, años de inflamación no tratada han dañado el tejido sinusal', dice Levitin. 'Esto puede provocar inflamación e hinchazón crónicas'. Se puede extraer una pequeña cantidad de dicho tejido en el consultorio de tu médico, pero una enfermedad de los senos nasales más extensa puede requerir una cirugía realizada bajo anestesia general. Esto se considera relativamente seguro para los adultos mayores: en un estudio publicado en el American Journal of Rhinology & Allergy en 2022, la tasa de complicaciones quirúrgicas fue del 3.9% para los adultos de 70 años o más, pero fue mayor (8%) para los pacientes más jóvenes.

423396736,"A medida que aumentan las opciones de alimentos sin gluten, puede resultar difícil decidir incluirlo o no en la alimentación. El gluten es una proteína que se encuentra en cereales, como el trigo, la cebada y el centeno. En la enfermedad celiaca, la ingesta de gluten desencadena una reacción autoinmune que provoca daño celular en el intestino delgado. Esto, a su vez, puede causar diarrea, fatiga, pérdida de peso, hinchazón, anemia y otros problemas, y derivar en complicaciones graves. De otro lado, está la intolerancia al gluten que es más común y se compara con la intolerancia a los lácteos, la cebolla o el ajo. «En la intolerancia al gluten no hay daño celular ni inflamación. Es más bien una sensibilidad. Si al consumir gluten se produce una reacción inmediata, como diarrea, es más probable que se trate de intolerancia al gluten y no de enfermedad celiaca, ya que, en la segunda, se trata de un proceso lento que no se suele sentir inmediatamente», explica el Dr. Sarmed Sami, gastroenterólogo de Clínica Mayo en Londres. De acuerdo con el especialista, la mayoría de las personas no tienen necesidad de eliminar por completo los alimentos que contienen gluten ya que no se ha demostrado ningún beneficio de hacerlo. Un signo de que una persona tiene intolerancia al gluten o celiaquía es la presencia de uno o más síntomas gastrointestinales, como diarrea, hinchazón o acidez estomacal, que disminuyen o desaparecen si se elimina el gluten de la dieta y aparecen nuevamente si la persona vuelve a comer alimentos con gluten. Si esto ocurre, es importante hacerse pruebas en caso de que se trate de una celiaquía más grave, afirma el Dr. Sami. Para tratar la intolerancia al gluten basta con reducir el consumo de alimentos que lo contienen, en lugar de eliminarlos por completo. «Depende del grado de intolerancia. A algunas personas les basta con reducir a la mitad la ingesta de gluten, mientras que otras necesitan reducir en mayor medida. Es diferente de la celiaquía, en la que se debe evitar el gluten de forma completa y estricta», añade. El diagnóstico de la celiaquía suele comenzar con un análisis de sangre para determinar si el organismo considera el gluten como un invasor y genera niveles elevados de anticuerpos para protegerse. Si el análisis de sangre da un resultado positivo, se usa una prueba por imágenes llamada endoscopia para realizar biopsias y verificar si hay daños en el intestino delgado. «Por lo general, recomendamos que las personas no sigan una dieta sin gluten si se les realizan pruebas de celiaquía, porque puede derivar en resultados falsos negativos en el análisis de sangre», afirma el Dr. Sami. Para la mayoría de los pacientes con un diagnóstico de celiaquía, la eliminación del gluten mantiene esta enfermedad bajo control, sin embargo, sin un diagnóstico de celiaquía, no hay motivos para eliminar el gluten. «No hay evidencia de que una dieta sin gluten por sí misma sea más saludable. Lo importante no es el gluten. Si se toma de ejemplo una galleta, tiene más que ver con la grasa y el azúcar de la galleta que con el gluten».",9578,medida que aumentan las opcione de alimentos sin gluten puede resultar difícil decidir incluirlo o en la alimentación el gluten es una proteína que se encuentra en cereale como el trigo la cebada y el centeno en la enfermedad celiaca la ingesta de gluten desencadena una reacción autoinmune que provoca daño celular en el intestino delgado esto su vez puede causar diarrea fatiga pérdida de peso hinchazón anemia y otros problemas y derivar en complicacione grave de otro lado está la intolerancia al gluten que es más común y se compara con la intolerancia los lácteos la cebolla o el ajo en la intolerancia al gluten hay daño celular ni inflamación es más bien una sensibilidad si al consumir gluten se produce una reacción inmediata como diarrea es más probable que se trate de intolerancia al gluten y de enfermedad celiaca ya que en la segunda se trata de un proceso lento que se suele sentir inmediatamente explica el sarmed sami gastroenterólogo de clínica mayo en londres de acuerdo con el especialista la mayoría de las personas tienen necesidad de eliminar por completo los alimentos que contienen gluten ya que se ha demostrado ningún beneficio de hacerlo un signo de que una persona tiene intolerancia al gluten o celiaquía es la presencia de uno o más síntoma gastrointestinales como diarrea hinchazón o acidez estomacal que disminuyen o desaparecen si se elimina el gluten de la dieta y aparecen nuevamente si la persona vuelve comer alimentos con gluten si esto ocurre es importante hacerse pruebas en caso de que se trate de una celiaquía más grave afirma el sami para tratar la intolerancia al gluten basta con reducir el consumo de alimentos que lo contienen en lugar de eliminarlos por completo depende del grado de intolerancia alguna personas les basta con reducir la mitad la ingesta de gluten mientras que otras necesitan reducir en mayor medida es diferente de la celiaquía en la que se debe evitar el gluten de forma completa y estricta añade el diagnóstico de la celiaquía suele comenzar con un análisis de sangre para determinar si el organismo considera el gluten como un invasor y genera niveles elevado de anticuerpos para protegerse si el análisis de sangre da un resultado positivo se usa una prueba por imágene llamada endoscopia para realizar biopsias y verificar si hay daños en el intestino delgado por lo general recomendamo que las personas sigan una dieta sin gluten si se les realizan pruebas de celiaquía porque puede derivar en resultados falsos negativos en el análisis de sangre afirma el sami para la mayoría de los paciente con un diagnóstico de celiaquía la eliminación del gluten mantiene esta enfermedad bajo control sin embargo sin un diagnóstico de celiaquía hay motivos para eliminar el gluten hay evidencia de que una dieta sin gluten por sí misma sea más saludable lo importante es el gluten si se toma de ejemplo una galleta tiene más que ver con la grasa y el azúcar de la galleta que con el gluten
423395568,"Foto: Reprodução/Freepik @jcomp Nas plataformas de mídias sociais como Instagram e Tiktok, o composto à base de plantas conhecido como berberina ganhou destaque entre usuários e influenciadores por supostamente auxiliar na redução de peso. Se seguirmos a orientação dos influenciadores, a berberina pode ser considerada como uma alternativa aos medicamentos populares para emagrecimento, como Ozempic e Wegovy. A utilização do composto como suplemento tornou-se tão comum que alguns a apelidaram de 'Ozempic Natural'. Apoiado a isso, alguns fabricantes de manipulados estão se aproveitando dessa tendência. No entanto, Patricia Liu , especialista em Medicina Tradicional Chinesa e fitoterapia, expressa preocupações em relação ao uso desse suplemento não regulamentado. 'O desafio com a berberina e outros suplementos naturais são que eles geralmente não são submetidos a rigorosos ensaios clínicos randomizados, como medicamentos convencionais', explica a profissional. LEIA TAMBÉM: O que é lipedema? Veja cirurgia, sintomas e como médico trata doença Segundo Patrícia, a planta é utilizada na Ayurveda e na medicina chinesa para tratar uma variedade de condições, como inflamações, feridas, constipação, hemorroidas e infecções em diferentes partes do corpo. 'Além disso, a berberina pode aumentar a produção natural do corpo do GLP-1, um hormônio gastrointestinal semelhante ao glucagon, utilizado em medicamentos como o Ozempic e outros novos tratamentos para perda de peso. No entanto, em termos de benefícios de emagrecimento, esses efeitos são pequenos', alerta. Isso não significa que a planta não tenha impacto nos processos metabólicos do corpo. Uma análise de vários estudos sobre a influência da berberina nos fatores de risco cardiovascular, incluindo a obesidade, revelou um modesto benefício na perda de peso. No entanto, isso não necessariamente significa que haja relevância clínica, ou seja, resultados relevantes, na prática. LEIA TAMBÉM: Colágeno ou whey protein: médica explica qual o melhor suplemento e como tomar Em média, entre os estudos, a redução do índice de massa corporal (IMC) foi de aproximadamente 0,25 em comparação com o grupo controle que recebeu um placebo. Comparando com Ozempic e Wegovy, que reduziram o IMC em relação ao placebo em aproximadamente 4,61 unidades de IMC, tornando-os cerca de 18 vezes mais eficazes do que a berberina. Portanto, ela tem algum efeito, mas nada significativo. A especialista destaca ainda possíveis efeitos colaterais da berberina, assim como qualquer outro suplemento, que incluem interações com outros medicamentos, como a metformina, prescrita para pessoas com diabetes e síndrome do ovário policístico, e com a ciclosporina. Outra interação conhecida ocorre com medicamentos sedativos, intensificando a sonolência e a respiração lenta. Além disso, não deve ser usada durante a gravidez ou amamentação, e seu uso frequente pode irritar o trato intestinal. LEIA TAMBÉM: Zolpidem causa crise de saúde no Brasil: '300 comprimidos por dia' A profissional explica que, certamente, a busca por soluções milagrosas e rápidas é uma tendência comum. 'Muitas vezes, as pessoas anseiam por resultados imediatos e fáceis, o que levou à popularização de produtos e práticas que prometem transformações rápidas, como no caso da berberina', afirma Patrícia. Porém, é importante lembrar que abordagens simples e fundamentais, como uma alimentação saudável, a prática de exercícios físicos e uma boa qualidade de sono, são componentes essenciais para manter a saúde e o bem-estar. 'Essas práticas, embora não sejam 'milagrosas,' são comprovadas como eficazes para promover uma vida saudável. As mudanças graduais e consistentes no estilo de vida têm um impacto duradouro e benéfico na saúde. Portanto, enquanto em vez de buscar atalhos, é importante reconhecer o valor do simples e constante compromisso com a saúde e o bem-estar', complementa. LEIA TAMBÉM: Tirzepatida emagrece? Entenda para que serve Mounjaro, a 'nova Ozempic' Além disso, é fundamental compreender que 'natural' nem sempre significa 'seguro' ou 'benéfico.' Muitas substâncias naturais podem ser tóxicas e prejudiciais à saúde. A natureza é repleta de compostos que podem ser venenosos em determinadas concentrações ou contextos. 'Por outro lado, a medicina moderna e os tratamentos farmacêuticos passam por rigorosos testes e regulamentações para garantir sua segurança e eficácia. Portanto, confiar cegamente em produtos rotulados como 'naturais' pode ser arriscado, pois esses produtos não passam pelo mesmo escrutínio regulatório', finaliza Patrícia. A natureza oferece uma gama diversificada de substâncias, algumas benéficas e outras prejudiciais. Portanto, é crucial avaliar cada substância ou produto individualmente com base em evidências científicas e consultar profissionais de saúde qualificados antes de adotar qualquer tratamento ou suplemento, seja natural ou não. EFEITO OZEMPIC:  Foto: Divulgação/Eli Lily Após diversos métodos famosos para perder peso, como a utilização do Ozempic , agora a dieta para emagrecer envolve o Mounjaro. O medicamento, cujo princípio ativo é a tirzepatida , foi aprovado pela Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária ( Anvisa. O remédio da farmacêutica Eli Lilly , no Brasil, é parecido com o Ozempic (semaglutida), com indicação para o tratamento da diabetes tipo 2. Emagrecer é um efeito secundário do uso.

Mounjaro, inclusive, ganhou repercussão neste último domingo (24) porque o jornalista Luiz Bacci, do Cidade Alerta, da RecordTV, confessou a Leo Dias que usa o medicamento, até então, só comprado nos Estados Unidos.

423392864,"di Paolo Ficara – Quiete interrotta. Quell’anno sabbatico richiesto ma non ottenuto a livello calcistico, ce lo stavamo comunque prendendo a livello giornalistico. Rinunciando alle polemiche, ai veleni, alle tentazioni di confrontarci con gli analfabeti funzionali. Mettendo da parte proprio l’argomento calcio, anche per sopraggiunta nausea. Tant’è che mentre verificavamo le notizie sulla manifestazione d’interesse per il Sant’Agata, stavamo realizzando un servizio sul volley maschile: sabato esordirà al PalaCalafiore la Domotek Reggio Calabria, in Serie B. Ve lo proporremo tra qualche ora. Intanto perdiamo questa imbattibilità durata qualche settimana, come ebbe a vantarsi – anni addietro – quel dirigente della Reggina in astinenza da microfono, che si vantava di non aver concesso interviste per quindici o trenta giorni consecutivi. E rispondiamo con questo che non vuole essere un articolo giornalistico, quanto una lettera aperta a Carmelo Versace attuale sindaco f.f. della Città Metropolitana di Reggio Calabria. Ci pare sia lo stesso Versace che nella vita civile, quindi non da politico, si occupi di call center. Come Saladini. E che per hobby, in passato abbia fatto l’arbitro. Come Cardona. Breve narrazione. A mezzogiorno di oggi 11 ottobre, è scaduto il termine per presentare manifestazione d’interesse a gestire l’intero centro sportivo Sant’Agata. Il Dispaccio, oltre a Strettoweb a firma del direttore Peppe Caridi, hanno fornito le notizie in rispettivo possesso tra le 18:00 e le 19:00 del medesimo giorno, all’incirca. Successivamente, a distanza di non troppi minuti, è giunta una dichiarazione del sindaco Versace alla stampa amica, in cui parla di una seconda manifestazione d’interesse che o sfugge a noi oppure risulta solo a lui. Il fatto che lei, illustre sindaco f.f. della Città Metropolitana, abbia rilasciato dichiarazioni non un minuto o un’ora dopo il termine ultimo per l’evidenza pubblica, bensì un minuto o un’ora dopo l’uscita di notizie giornalistiche , già di per sé rappresenta un’infelice coincidenza. Però le vogliamo credere, per una volta. A patto che in questa occasione faccia cantare carta, mostrandoci la domanda inviata dalla società denominata La Fenice Amaranto – del quale si è dichiarato a conoscenza – per gestire l’intero centro sportivo Sant’Agata. Possibilmente con un comunicato stampa, se non è troppo. Già qualche giorno fa, abbiamo posto pubblicamente delle domande a cui solo lei avrebbe avuto titolo a rispondere. Circa la legittimità della revoca della concessione del Sant’Agata alla Reggina 1914 srl, azienda ancora in vita. Tra queste domande, c’era il dubbio su chi stesse pagando la corrente presso il centro sportivo . Sempre sulla stampa amica, abbiamo letto un virgolettato di Versace in cui sostiene che per una settimana è stata la Città Metropolitana a pagare 700 bellissimi euro al giorno, per un generatore. Anche in questo caso, se Versace ci mostra la norma o la regola che determina come si debba mantenere la corrente ad un privato in una struttura provinciale con i soldi dei contribuenti , ci risparmia la fatica di confrontarci con tanti avvocati. Se Versace avesse voluto agevolare il lavoro della Fenice, sarebbe stato ampiamente apprezzabile presentarsi in persona nella sede nazionale dell’Enel, chiedendo di riattivare la corrente presso il Sant’Agata con la massima urgenza, e garantendo sulla solvibilità e sulla serietà di una società fresca di investitura da parte di un’amministrazione comunale. Non di certo attingendo dalle casse di un Ente , seppur per cifre alla portata. Talmente alla portata, che non si capisce perché non le abbia tirate fuori il locatario. Poi ci sarebbe da rispondere a tutti gli altri dubbi che ci siamo posti, come testata giornalistica, sull’interruzione unilaterale della convenzione per il Sant’Agata con la Reggina. Specie sul mancato sgombero degli uffici all’interno dello stesso Sant’Agata, ove vi è la presenza di beni materiali inequivocabilmente appartenenti alla Reggina 1914 srl, azienda – ribadiamo – ancora in vita. Versace, purtroppo per lei e per tutti noi, veniamo da un’estate in cui avete – o abbiamo, se preferisce – riempito la testa della gente con ritmo martellante, su questioni inesistenti e con soluzioni farneticanti. Lei è lo stesso che leggeva in diretta un comunicato – mai giunto alla nostra testata – di una società viticola pugliese, che a suo dire – o volere – avrebbe dovuto rilevare da Manuele Ilari le quote della Reggina. Magari assieme al venditore di scarpe lametino. Nella prospettiva di vincere il ricorso al Consiglio di Stato con tale inaffondabile proprietà, consentendo la disputa del campionato di Serie B. Come vede, la classe giornalistica di Reggio Calabria le è così amica che nessuno le ha chiesto dove siano finiti questi imprenditori pronti a sacrificare i propri fatturati per la Reggina in Serie B, quando c’era – a distanza di poche settimane – da ripartire dal basso . Allo stesso modo, ancora nessuno è andato a Locri per chiedere a chi sia venuta – prima che a lei – l’idea, peraltro improcedibile a termini di regolamento federale, di una cessione del titolo sportivo. Noi forse non diventeremo amici, ma ci siamo anche stancati di passare per nemici. E fino a qualche ora fa, ce ne stavamo in santa pace. Prendendo atto di aver perso il calcio professionistico per almeno un biennio, se tutto va bene. Quindi Versace, se almeno stavolta è in grado di documentare le proprie dichiarazioni, chiederemo scusa pubblicamente per aver diffuso una notizia incompleta. In caso contrario, non ci sarà bisogno che si dimetta: tra un paio di settimane, in base al pronunciamento della cassazione sul sindaco sospeso, si saprà se lei mollerà lo scranno causa elezioni; o se sarà il rientrante Falcomatà a fare un immediato bilancio del suo operato. Però almeno, in queste due rimanenti settimane, eviti ogni argomento che riguardi lo sport. Per il momento, forse sbagliando nel generalizzare, manteniamo il preconcetto che chi si occupa di call center dovrebbe stare lontano dal mondo del calcio.",9578,di paolo ficara quiete interrotta

qualche giorno fa abbiamo posto pubblicamente delle domande cui solo lei avrebbe avuto titolo rispondere circa la legittimità della revoca della concessione del alla reggina srl azienda ancora vita tra queste domande il dubbio su chi stesse pagando la corrente presso il centro sportivo sempre sulla stampa amica abbiamo letto un virgolettato di versace cui sostiene che una settimana è stata la città metropolitana pagare bellissimi euro al giorno un generatore anche questo caso se versace ci mostra la norma o la regola che determina come si debba mantenere la corrente ad un privato una struttura provinciale con soldi dei contribuenti ci risparmia la fatica di confrontarci con tanti avvocati se versace avesse voluto agevolare il lavoro della fenice sarebbe stato ampiamente apprezzabile presentarsi persona nella sede nazionale chiedendo di riattivare la corrente presso il con la massima urgenza e garantendo sulla solvibilità e sulla serietà di una società fresca di investitura da parte di comunale non di certo attingendo dalle casse di un ente seppur cifre alla portata talmente alla portata che non si capisce perché non le abbia tirate fuori il locatario poi ci sarebbe da rispondere tutti gli altri dubbi che ci siamo posti come testata giornalistica unilaterale della convenzione il con la reggina specie sul mancato sgombero degli uffici dello stesso ove vi è la presenza di beni materiali inequivocabilmente appartenenti alla reggina srl azienda ribadiamo ancora vita versace purtroppo lei e tutti noi veniamo da cui avete o abbiamo se preferisce riempito la testa della gente con ritmo martellante su questioni inesistenti e con soluzioni farneticanti lei è lo stesso che leggeva diretta un comunicato mai giunto alla nostra testata di una società viticola pugliese che suo dire o volere avrebbe dovuto rilevare da manuele ilari le quote della reggina magari assieme al venditore di scarpe lametino nella prospettiva di vincere il ricorso al consiglio di stato con tale inaffondabile proprietà consentendo la disputa del campionato di serie come vede la classe giornalistica di reggio calabria le è così amica che nessuno le ha chiesto dove siano finiti questi imprenditori pronti sacrificare propri fatturati la reggina serie b quando distanza di poche settimane da ripartire dal basso allo stesso modo ancora nessuno è andato locri chiedere chi sia venuta prima che lei peraltro improcedibile termini di regolamento federale di una cessione del titolo sportivo noi forse non diventeremo amici ma ci siamo anche stancati di passare nemici e fino qualche ora fa ce ne stavamo santa pace prendendo atto di aver perso il calcio professionistico almeno un biennio se tutto va bene quindi versace se almeno stavolta è grado di documentare le proprie dichiarazioni chiederemo scusa pubblicamente aver diffuso una notizia incompleta caso contrario non ci sarà bisogno che si dimetta tra un paio di settimane base al pronunciamento della cassazione sul sindaco sospeso si saprà se lei mollerà lo scranno causa elezioni o se sarà il rientrante falcomatà fare un immediato bilancio del suo operato però almeno queste rimanenti settimane eviti ogni argomento che riguardi lo sport il momento forse sbagliando nel generalizzare manteniamo il preconcetto che chi si occupa di center dovrebbe stare lontano dal mondo del calcio

423391008,"Dr Lisa Ackerley, food hygiene expert and Global Hygiene Council representative, says it's vital to give chopping boards a proper wash after you cut potatoes as unwashed boards could became a breeding ground for bacteria and pathogens. While we're all aware of the dangers of raw and undercooked meat, uncooked vegetables can also lead to health problems. Experts speaking to the Huffington Post said that raw potatoes were the most dangerous as they contain pathogens, which lead to diseases and illnesses such as gastric distress and diarrhoea. . Research has shown that chopping boards harbour 200% more faecal bacteria than toilet seats and uncleaned chopping boards contained harmful bacteria including E.coli, according to Read more: Dr Ackerley said: 'In all surveys I have ever done focusing on the home, chopping boards come out really badly, the reason being because people don't clean them properly. People pay lots of attention to the toilet, using lots of disinfectant and think that is the dirtiest place in the house. But nearly every study I have been a part of, it is the kitchen where the most dangerous bacteria lurks. Raw meat, raw vegetables and poultry are the culprits.' How to prevent a breeding ground for bacteria Never prepare ready-to-eat food on a chopping board that has been used for raw meat unless it has been thoroughly washed first. In professional kitchens, there’s a colour-coded chopping board for every job. Why not invest in a couple of colour-coded boards to separate raw and cooked foods? If your board is covered in scratches, buy a new one. Bacteria love to hide inside the grooves. Choose plastic or acrylic chopping boards. Non-porous ones are easier to clean than wooden and less prone to scratching. Wash acrylic and plastic boards in the dishwasher. Rinse your board with hot soapy water after each use then leave it to dry naturally.",9578,dr lisa ackerley food hygiene expert global hygiene council representative say vital chopping board proper wash cut potato unwashed board breeding ground bacteria pathogen aware danger raw undercooked meat uncooked vegetable lead health problem expert speak huffington post say raw potato dangerous contain pathogen lead disease illness gastric distress diarrhoea research show chop board harbour faecal bacteria toilet seat uncleaned chopping board contain harmful bacteria include accord read dr ackerley say survey focus home chop board come badly reason people clean properly people pay lot attention toilet lot disinfectant think dirty place house nearly study kitchen dangerous bacteria lurk raw meat raw vegetable poultry culprit prevent breeding ground bacteria prepare ready eat food chop board raw meat thoroughly wash professional kitchen colour code chop board job invest couple colour code board separate raw cooked food board cover scratch buy new bacteria love hide inside groove choose plastic acrylic chopping board non porous one easy clean wooden prone scratch wash acrylic plastic board dishwasher rinse board hot soapy water use leave dry naturally

423386975,"The dose that man ingested, however, is a million times higher than the microgram doses detected in the food samples. Narasin was detected in a Wendy’s cheeseburger and found in trace amounts in a meal from Dunkin’, Domino’s, and a Starbucks sandwich. Narasin is an antibiotic and antiparasitic feed additive that helps control parasitic infections in fattened chicken. It is also often added to cattle feed, as it increases dry matter intake. Both narasin and monensin are ionophores, meaning they can disturb the balance of ions in cells and are often used in animals to control bacterial and parasitic infections. Side effects of narasin in animals include anorexia, diarrhea, and degeneration of heart and skeletal muscles. These antibiotic ionophores are not used in humans due to concerns of toxicity, though there are few cases of documented toxicity from these drugs. Nicarbazin, an animal antiparasitic and contraceptive, was detected in the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich sample. The drug is primarily used as an antiparasitic drug in fattened chickens and turkeys, but it has also been used for population control of geese and pigeons. Since it is highly toxic to agricultural embryos and decreases egg laying and hatching among grown poultry populations, many farmers have called for more regulations to protect their animals from such exposures. To date, no reports have shown that nicarbazin causes toxic effects in humans, though its long-term ramifications are unknown. One research report assumed that nicarbazin would be safe for consumers since most turkeys fed the drug would act as a filter, breaking down the drug before it reached the market. 'The impact of millions of Americans, especially children and young adults, consuming a known animal contraceptive daily is concerning,' said Zen Honeycutt, MAA's executive director. 'With infertility problems on the rise, the reproductive health of this generation is front and center for us, in light of these results.' Few studies have investigated the effects of veterinary drugs in humans. 'That's the problem,' Ms. Honeycutt told The Epoch Times. 'These are veterinary drugs and hormones ... so the only studies that I have found and that you will find will be for animals. [They're] not authorized for humans, and yet they're being allowed [into the food supply].' However, she was suspicious that other chains may also be affected. 'My understanding is that they're grinding the meat up of hundreds of birds in order to make these processed meat patties. So when one is contaminated, it likely contaminates possibly hundreds of other samples ... If one comes down with this particular disease, then the farmer will likely treat any of the birds at a facility,' Ms. Honeycutt said. When asked about potential package contamination, Mr. Fagan from the Health Research Institute said that the packages came from different states across the United States, so while one package might be contaminated, it would be difficult for all of them to be contaminated.",9578,dose man ingest million time high microgram dose detect food sample narasin detect wendy cheeseburger find trace amount meal dunkin domino starbucks sandwich narasin antibiotic antiparasitic feed additive help control parasitic infection fatten chicken add cattle feed increase dry matter intake narasin monensin ionophore mean disturb balance ion cell animal control bacterial parasitic infection effect narasin animal include anorexia diarrhea degeneration heart skeletal muscle antibiotic ionophore human concern toxicity case document toxicity drug nicarbazin animal antiparasitic contraceptive detect chick fil chicken sandwich sample drug primarily antiparasitic drug fatten chicken turkey population control geese pigeon highly toxic agricultural embryo decrease egg lay hatch grown poultry population farmer call regulation protect animal exposure date report show nicarbazin cause toxic effect human long term ramification unknown research report assume nicarbazin safe consumer turkey feed drug act filter break drug reach market impact million americans especially child young adult consume know animal contraceptive daily concern say zen honeycutt maa executive director infertility problem rise reproductive health generation center light result study investigate effect veterinary drug human problem honeycutt tell epoch times veterinary drug hormone study find find animal authorize human allow food supply suspicious chain affect understanding grind meat hundred bird order process meat patty contaminate likely contaminate possibly hundred sample come particular disease farmer likely treat bird facility honeycutt say ask potential package contamination fagan health research institute say package come different state united states package contaminate difficult contaminate
423402399,"A good brunch is marked by not just its food, but also by the drinks accompanying it — such as the ever popular mimosa. And, at certain Bay Area brunch spots, people can order an indulgent variant: bottomless mimosas. But this menu item has also caused problems for many of these same restaurants, they say. Some diners, especially since the pandemic, have been drinking too much and vomiting in bathrooms or tables. It’s become enough of a problem that some brunch spots are starting to implement restrictions or even fees for puking, In Oakland, for example, SFGATE reports restaurant Kitchen Story has a sign posted in its bathroom reading: 'Dear all mimosa lovers, Please drink responsibly and know your limits. A $50 cleaning fees will automatically include in your tap when you throw up in our public areas. Thank you so much for your understanding.' The co-owner of Kitchen Story, Chaiporn Kitsadaviseksak, told SFGATE that the sign seems to be working. Vomiting was a big problem before, but now he can't recall actually having to charge anyone the fee. Kitchen Story isn’t the only restaurant to implement a fee, but charging extra is only one method restaurants have adopted to curb intoxicated vomiting. Another change, which Kitchen Story has also implemented, is enforcing timed seating to limit how much people drink as well as to help staff turn tables. And some restaurants have replaced the typical carafe of mimosa with a staff member who refills diners’ glasses individually. Something else that has helped curb people overdoing it, according to , is mandatory Responsible Beverage Service training for workers who serve alcohol. That means servers are better prepared to watch customer behavior and make sure people aren’t overserved.",9578,good brunch mark food drink accompany popular mimosa certain bay area brunch spot people order indulgent variant bottomless mimosa menu item cause problem restaurant diner especially pandemic drink vomit bathroom table problem brunch spot start implement restriction fee puking oakland example sfgate report restaurant kitchen story sign post bathroom read dear mimosa lover drink responsibly know limit cleaning fee automatically include tap throw public area thank understanding co owner kitchen story chaiporn kitsadaviseksak tell sfgate sign work vomiting big problem recall actually have charge fee kitchen story restaurant implement fee charge extra method restaurant adopt curb intoxicated vomiting change kitchen story implement enforce time seating limit people drink help staff turn table restaurant replace typical carafe mimosa staff member refill diner glass individually help curb people overdo accord mandatory responsible beverage service training worker serve alcohol mean server well prepared watch customer behavior sure people overserve

According to the Mayo Clinic, peptic ulcers are 'open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper portion of your small intestine.' Springsteen never said exactly what symptoms he was fighting, only that he was 'heartbroken' to be sidelined for the next few months. 'Over here on E Street, we’re heartbroken to have to postpone these shows,' Springsteen said in a statement posted on his site and social-media platforms on Sept. 6. 'We’ll be back to pick up these shows and then some.' But the Born in the USA singer was still far from 100%. 'Thanks to all my friends and fans for your good wishes, encouragement, and support. I’m on the mend and can’t wait to see you all next year,' Springsteen wrote in a message to fans.

423402633,"Korean golfer An Byeong-hun has been suspended for three months for violating the PGA Tour Anti-Doping Policy after taking over-the-counter cough syrup that contained a banned substance. The PGA Tour announced Thursday that An has been retroactively suspended from Aug. 31, making him available to play again from Dec. 1. “An tested positive for a substance prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) contained in a cough medicine available over the counter in his native Korea,” a statement from the office of the PGA commissioner said. “He has cooperated fully with the TOUR throughout the process and accepted his suspension.” According to local reports, An used cough medicine from Korea without knowing that the medicine contained a substance prohibited by WADA. An confirmed that he took the medicine unknowingly and will be more careful in the future in a statement shared on Instagram. “In August, I was suffering from a head cold and cough,” An wrote. “As my symptoms worsened, my mother suggested I take a widely available medication from Korea that had helped her through a similar ailment. “I took this medicine without checking its contents first only to later find that it contained a substance that is prohibited under the PGA Tour’s anti-doping program. It was the only time I used this medication and in no way did I take it to gain a competition advantage. “I regret not being more thorough in my decision-making and take full responsibility for my actions. I’d like to thank the PGA Tour for supporting me during this process and look forward to returning to competition in the new year.” An, known as Ben An in the United States, is a popular figure on the PGA Tour but is yet to pick up a win.

Solángel Carrizo es una pequeña guerrera sanjuanina de 4 años, que desde hace casi dos meses transita un difícil momento de salud y su familia pide ayuda para trasladarla a Buenos Aires y hallar su diagnóstico. El pasado 18 de agosto, la niña de Media Agua comenzó a presentar cuadros de fiebre y vómito, y fue entonces que empezó un camino que hasta el momento no tiene solución. Luego de estar internada en el hospital de la zona, fue trasladada al Hospital Rawson ya con una inflamación en la garganta y posteriormente operada de gangleos.

423397435,"Si conclude in questi giorni il festival internazionale del documentario di Yamagata. L’evento, che nasce nel 1989 e che si svolge ogni due anni nell’omonima cittadina nel nord del Giappone, è tornato quest’anno a svolgersi in presenza, dopo che l’edizione del 2021 era stata trasferita online a causa della pandemia. Fra le prerogative del festival, il saper offrire una selezione dei migliori film di non-fiction provenienti da ogni parte del mondo, ma soprattutto l’essere una grande finestra aperta sul cinema documentario, in tutte le sue sfaccettate, forme e declinazioni, proveniente dal continente asiatico. «A night of knowing nothing»di Payal Kapadia. IN QUESTO SENSO , uno dei focus più affascinanti di questa edizione è stato quello sul cinema prodotto in maniera indipendente e segreta in Myanmar dopo il colpo di stato del primo febbraio 2021. Losing Ground è un mediometraggio del 2023 diretto da un regista che rimane, per sicurezza, anonimo, sulla sua personale esperienza nelle proteste dopo il colpo di stato. Si tratta di una dolorosa riflessione su come la presa del potere da parte della giunta militare abbia distrutto la vita del protagonista, il regista stesso. Dopo aver partecipato alle proteste infatti, l’uomo viene imprigionato per otto mesi e una volta rilasciato non riesce più a ritornare alla vita pre-prigionia. Le immagini all’interno della sua abitazione sono spesso immerse nell’oscurità e riflettono lo stato del regista che non può scrollarsi di dosso un senso di terrore che pervade ogni fibra del suo corpo. Il solo vedere un mezzo di trasporto della polizia o dell’esercito lo fa tremare e gli provoca nausea, come afferma il regista stesso verso la fine del lavoro, e Yangon, la più grande città del paese e luogo in cui vive, è ora diventata per lui come una grande prigione. Completamente diverso per stile e concezione, ma altrettanto interessante è Journey of a Bird del 2021, anche questo a firma anonima. Si tratta di un breve lavoro filmato nei giorni e mesi successivi al colpo di stato e che documenta la vita quotidiana di un gruppo di giovani, tutti sui vent’anni. Il lavoro racconta lo scorrere dei giorni tra proteste nelle strade, canzoni cantate insieme e la necessità di cambiare appartamento per ben tre volte in un breve lasso di tempo, per paura di essere perseguitati dalla polizia. Uno spaccato che, pur mostrando alcune scene della resistenza e della violenza nelle strade, si concentra, come una sorta di diario, sulla paura istigata nella popolazione e come questa abbia cambiato radicalmente la vita di un gruppo di giovanissimi. La redazione consiglia: Sempre ambientato in Myanmar, Above and Below the Ground , diretto da Emile Hong del 2023, è invece un lavoro che esplora le difficoltà della minoranza etnica cristiana che abita la regione di Kachin al nord del paese, vicino al confine con la Cina. La vita della piccola comunità sta per venire sconvolta dalla costruzione di un’enorme diga, affidata ad una compagnia cinese. La resistenza viene descritta dal punto di vista di due donne, in prima linea nelle proteste, e di un gruppo rock che attraverso le sue canzoni esprime il dissenso di un’intera comunità. LE VOCI femminili sono anche protagoniste di due film girati in India sulla nuova legge di cittadinanza e più in generale sulla situazione politica e sociale da quando il governo di estrema destra di Narendra Modi è salito al potere. A Night of Knowing Nothing è un documentario sperimentale, già passato a Cannes nel 2021 e diretto da Payal Kapadia. Il film trasforma in immagini sgranate in bianco e nero il senso di orrore e di terrore in cui vivono le giovani generazioni di studenti universitari a Nuova Delhi, fra discriminazioni di casta e repressioni della polizia. Formalmente molto diverso, Land of My Dreams (2023) affronta lo stesso periodo e le stesse tensioni sociali da un punto di vista più femminista e forse più articolato. «Losing Ground» è diretto da un regista che rimane, per sicurezza, anonimo, una dolorosa riflessione su come la presa del potere da parte della giunta militare abbia distrutto la sua vita La regista Nausheen Khan, studentessa universitaria, racconta in forma di riflessione diaristica e attraverso interviste e immagini girate in loco, la storia delle donne che hanno formato il movimento non-violento contro la legge indiana di modifica della cittadinanza. Tra il 2019 e il 2020, le donne di Shaheen Bagh a Nuova Delhi, studentesse, madri e donne più anziane, hanno protestato la repressione sistematica contro la minoranza musulmana, una delle declinazioni nazionaliste del governo di Modi. Mese dopo mese questi sit-in pacifici si sono estesi nel resto della capitale e del paese, creando un movimento di protesta più esteso che ha criticato le politiche del governo in tutte le sue sfaccettature destrorse. Il lavoro oltre a fornire un complesso quadro della situazione, offre anche alcune dolorose riflessioni della regista che, in quanto musulmana, si trova al centro di una personale tensione fra il suo credo religioso e le sue esperienze sociali. FIN DAI SUOI INIZI , una delle caratteristiche peculiari del festival di Yamagata è stata quella di esplorare la storia meno conosciuta del cinema documentario giapponese. Quest’anno un vasto programma, ben 38 lavori, è stato dedicato al regista, poeta e studioso di cinema Shinkichi Noda (1913-1993). Una produzione variegata che copre un ampio lasso di tempo, dal 1941 al 1991, e che va dai film industriali e d’educazione con piglio avanguardistico realizzati negli anni Sessanta, ai lavori sul folklore, sperimentali o meno, girati dai Settanta fino ai primi anni Novanta. Ma nel programma sono stati presentati anche documentari indipendenti che raccontano le attività, le lotte e gli scioperi sindacali degli anni Cinquanta, le proteste contro l’Anpo (il trattato di mutua cooperazione e sicurezza tra Giappone e Stati uniti) del decennio successivo, fino ad alcuni lavori più formalmente e dichiaratamente sperimentali. Una menzione speciale la merita The Matsukawa Incident: Seeing the Truth Through the Wall del 1954, con cui Noda costruisce un documentario di contro-informazione molto moderno per stile e metodo, sul deragliamento di un treno nel 1949. Tre persone perirono nell’incidente e membri del partito comunista e del sindacato dei ferrovieri furono ingiustamente accusati di sabotaggio. Attraverso interviste, minuziose ricostruzioni dell’accaduto e grafici animati, il documentario smonta passo dopo passo tutti gli assunti su cui si fondavano le accuse. A dare ragione a Noda e collaboratori, il fatto che successivamente tutti gli accusati furono prosciolti ed il caso chiuso definitivamente senza trovare i colpevoli nel 1970. Tutti i premiati dell'edizione 2023 Il premio Robert and Frances Flaherty per il miglior film in competizione è andato a «A Night of Knowing Nothing» di Payal Kapadia, mentre il Mayor’s Prize, sempre nella stessa categoria, a «The Visit and a Secret Garden» di Irene M. Borrego. Premio speciale della giuria a Ekiem Barbier, Guilhem Causse e Quentin L’helgoualc’h, registi del francese «Knit’s Island». Nel programma New Asian Currents Awards, il premio principale, l’Ogawa Shinsuke Prize, è stato vinto dal birmano «Losing Ground» (anonimo), mentre l’Awards of Excellence è andato a «A Lost Heart and

423402733,"Abstract. Enterobacteriaceae bacteria are prone to opportunistic pathogenic behavior during gut dysbiosis, potentially influenced by distinct environmental cues within the compromised gut. Chemosensing systems play a central role in allowing bacteria to perceive and react to physicochemical signals within the gastrointestinal (GI) milieu, influencing their motility, population organization, and colonization site preferences. We investigated the chemosensory behavior of Enterobacteriaceae, a bacterial family associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and sepsis, to learn whether these bacteria respond to human serum, a chemical stimulus they encounter during GI bleeding. We discover that clinical isolates of diverse non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri all sense human serum as a potent attractant. Using a custom injection-based microfluidics device we simulated GI bleeding and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to stimulate motile cells to rapidly swim toward, and congregate at, the serum source. With exceptional temporal resolution, we determined that this response is orchestrated through chemotaxis, with a major chemical cue driving chemoattraction being L-serine, an amino acid abundantly present in serum, recognized by the chemoreceptor Tsr. To gain deeper insight into the structural basis of this phenomenon, we successfully elucidated the crystal structure of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine. This structure allowed for a precise characterization of the ligand-binding site, thereby correcting prior misconceptions regarding L-serine positioning and accurately defining the chemoreceptor's ligand-binding interactions. Building upon these structural insights, we identified a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues and mapped the phylogenetic distribution of this chemoreceptor. We found that Tsr, which mediates serum chemoattraction, is widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and many World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Given that Enterobacteriaceae are a primary cause of bacteremia and sepsis, particularly as a complication of inflammatory bowel diseases, their remarkable sensitivity to serum as a chemoattractant could relate to their proclivity for bloodstream entry. Footnotes This revised manuscript focuses on serum chemoattraction mediated by chemoreceptor Tsr and how our crystal structure of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium Tsr provides insights into its molecular function. We wanted to discuss the new context of L-serine chemoattraction as a molecular cue in serum. Our previous submission focused on the implications of serum chemoattraction and its link to sepsis. However, based on feedback from other researchers in the field, we have shifted the focus of the paper to the molecular mechanisms of serum chemoattraction. We have also revised Figure 6 to remove panel D, which depicts a model of pathogenesis that is no longer the main focus of the paper.",9578,abstract enterobacteriaceae bacteria prone opportunistic pathogenic behavior gut dysbiosis potentially influence distinct environmental cue compromise gut chemosense system play central role allow bacteria perceive react physicochemical signal gastrointestinal gi milieu influence motility population organization colonization site preference investigate chemosensory behavior enterobacteriaceae bacterial family associate gastrointestinal gi bleeding sepsis learn bacteria respond human serum chemical stimulus encounter gi bleeding discover clinical isolate diverse non typhoidal salmonella enterica serovar escherichia coli citrobacter koseri sense human serum potent attractant custom injection base microfluidic device simulate gi bleeding find femtolit volume human serum sufficient stimulate motile cell rapidly swim congregate serum source exceptional temporal resolution determine response orchestrate chemotaxis major chemical cue drive chemoattraction l serine amino acid abundantly present serum recognize chemoreceptor tsr gain deep insight structural basis phenomenon successfully elucidate crystal structure salmonella typhimurium tsr complex l serine structure allow precise characterization ligand bind site correct prior misconception l serine positioning accurately define chemoreceptor ligand bind interaction build structural insight identify conserve amino acid recognition motif l serine share tsr orthologue map phylogenetic distribution chemoreceptor find tsr mediate serum chemoattraction widely conserve enterobacteriaceae world health organization priority pathogen associate bloodstream infection give enterobacteriaceae primary cause bacteremia sepsis particularly complication inflammatory bowel disease remarkable sensitivity serum chemoattractant relate proclivity bloodstream entry footnote revise manuscript focus serum chemoattraction mediate chemoreceptor tsr crystal structure salmonella enterica typhimurium tsr provide insight molecular function want discuss new context l serine chemoattraction molecular cue serum previous submission focus implication serum chemoattraction link sepsis base feedback researcher field shift focus paper molecular mechanism serum chemoattraction revise figure remove panel d depict model pathogenesis long main focus paper

423395520,"Each year, about 14 million women experience PPH resulting in about 70,000 deaths globally. Even when women survive, they often need urgent surgical interventions to control the bleeding and may be left with life-long reproductive disability. While international developmental partners tend to have similar objectives regarding PPH priorities, efforts are in need of alignment. The Global Summit on Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH Summit) held 7-10 March 2023 in Dubai, UAE sought to catalyze alignments among experts, promote coalitions, accelerate progress with pledges of support from donors and strong ministry of health commitments to relieve the burden of PPH and eliminate avoidable maternal deaths. Risk factors include anemia, placental abnormalities and other pregnancy complications such as infections and pre-eclampsia. The Roadmap to Combat Postpartum Haemorrhage Between 2023 and 2030 was developed collaboratively with stakeholders at the PPH Summit to outline a shared vision for getting back on track towards the SDG target on reducing maternal mortality. pll/rgh/lpn.",9578,year million woman experience pph result death globally woman survive need urgent surgical intervention control bleeding leave life long reproductive disability international developmental partner tend similar objective pph priority effort need alignment global summit postpartum haemorrhage pph summit hold march dubai uae seek catalyze alignment expert promote coalition accelerate progress pledge support donor strong ministry health commitment relieve burden pph eliminate avoidable maternal death risk factor include anemia placental abnormality pregnancy complication infection pre eclampsia roadmap combat postpartum haemorrhage develop collaboratively stakeholder pph summit outline share vision get track sdg target reduce maternal mortality pll rgh lpn

423392066,"Bologna, 11 ottobre 2023 – Straordinaria in difesa, ineccepibile in attacco. Non c’è due senza tre e così la Fortitudo scuce i 2 punti alla corazzata Forlì degli e x Antimo Martino e Daniele Cinciarini nel derby infrasettimanale emiliano-romagnolo e col punteggio di 73-63 mette in congelatore la terza vittoria consecutiva, preparando nel migliore dei modi la trasferta di sabato a Nardò (palla a due ore 20,30). Sotto la volta del ‘Madison’ di piazza Azzarita (4830 spettatori, ma trasferta vietata agli ospiti, come lamentato dalla Fossa dei Leoni con lo striscione ‘Trasferte libere’ esposto nel settore ospiti) ricco prepartita , con lo scambio di gagliardetti a centrocampo tra i presidenti biancoblù Stefano Tedeschi e Pierluigi Bissa , rispettivamente Fortitudo Pallacanestro e Fortitudo Baseball, fresca di quattordicesimo scudetto. La cronaca. Sono le triple di Ogden e Aradori a infiammare il PalaDozza in avvio di gara, antipasto dello 0-4 di Johnson (8 punti e 11 di valutazione nei primi 10’) che riporta repentinamente il punteggio in parità (6-6). La Effe chiude i boccaporti difensivi e nell’altra metà campo inizia ad attaccare il canestro da distanza ravvicinata: sull’asse Morgillo-Fantinelli-Aradori i biancoblù si portano sul 14-10. Tuttavia con la tripla di Pollone, l’appoggio del subentrato Cinciarini e i liberi di Zampini Forlì rammenda in meno di un minuto, prima di rimettere la testa avanti 16-17: appoggio di Freeman su lob di Ogden, tripla di Radonjic dall’altra parte e il primo quarto va in archivio 18-20. Cinciarini brucia sul primo passo Panni e fa toccare il +4 ai forlivesi, prima che lo stesso Panni e Sergio fiondino il 6-0 che costringe coach Martino al time-out (24-22). Pascolo sembra ridare smalto a Forlì nel momento di blocco offensivo dei suoi, ma sull’altro fronte arrivano i punti di Freeman e l’assist per Sergio che fanno tuonare di rabbia coach Martino, al secondo time-out ravvicinato: Allen risponde presente e con 5 punti difficilissimi riporta i biancorossi a +1. Appoggio di Fantinelli, libero e arresto e tiro di Bolpin: in una fase di stallo del match la Effe resta ancorata alle sue certezze e apre a +4 con 2’ sul cronometro, ma non riesce a dare la spallata ai romagnoli, che col sempreverde Cinciarini centrano dall’angolo la tripla del 36-34. Col cesto rocambolesco di Radonjic e con l’appoggio di Freeman (12 di valutazione dopo 20’) su lob di Fantinelli la Effe chiude avanti 38-36. Sentito durante l’intervallo ai microfoni di RaiSport, il vicepresidente ‘Teo’ Alibegovic ha parlato della recente rivoluzione societaria: 'Abbiamo tirato una riga e deciso di ripartire con il progetto originario, la svolta è stata ad aprile e maggio. Ci siamo detti ‘Vediamo se siamo in sintonia come società per cambiare aria’: il pubblico ha risposto positivamente. Succede solo in Fortitudo e il dato degli abbonamenti è impressionante e non si trova in Europa un’intesa simile. Ora facciamo un passo alla volta e mai più lungo della gamba'. ‘Fante’+Bolpin+Aradori: Bologna lascia letteralmente ai blocchi di partenza Forlì, a digiuno per 6’, e apre sul 52-36 (+16, massimo vantaggio) che obbliga i romagnoli al time-out per riordinare le idee in un PalaDozza che ribolle a sostegno dei padroni di casa, straordinari in difesa. Forlì appare l’ombra dei primi 20’ e sono due tiri liberi di Pascolo a fermare un’emorragia da 14-0 di parziale: Aradori rimpolpa il proprio tabellino personale a suon di triple, tocca quota 22 punti e lascia spazio a Conti con 2’ ancora da giocare, ma la partita del numero 5 si esaurisce in meno di un minuto, richiamato in panchina da un infuriato Caja. Nel mentre la Effe amministra e si va alla terza sirena sul 57-43. Tuttavia Allen, Cinciarini e Johnson fanno intendere che Forlì non vuole regalare la partita a Bologna e segnano il 6-0 che tampona l’esuberanza locale: Bologna smette di segnare per 4’ fino alla tripla di Aradori che mette la pezza nel momento più delicato della gestione della partita. Zampini e Johnson restano sulla scia dei biancoblù, ma il semigancio di Ogden tiene la forbice aperta a +9. Tripla di Cinciarini , liberi e schiacciata di Freeman: la Effe è in controllo e non deve far altro che godersi lo spettacolo del suo pubblico, che a gran voce chiede la serie A.

423376154,"Campbell allegedly struck Colette Myers, 33, possibly with a baseball bat which he said she referred to as 'Benny the bat', causing an artery in her neck and spine to tear, leading to bleeding on the brain and death. Colette, 33, was found dead at the couple's home in , last April. Campbell initially said he had woke up and found her dead then later claimed she had tripped on some ladders in the flat before getting into bed. He denies murdering Colette and is being tried by a jury at Giving evidence, Campbell, 33, said he had known Colette since he was 16 and had started going out with her when he was around 21 or 22. He said he loved her and continued to love her at the time of the alleged offence. He admitted they had argued 'quite a lot' and said it was 'about debts and daft things'. Asked if he had assaulted her in the past, he replied: 'Aye, more near to when we were first together.' He admitted having pleaded guilty to battery on her on two occasions. He said he had punched her in the past earlier in their relationship. Asked why he punched her, he said: 'Only when she was physically attacking me.' Campbell said he never caused her serious injury and never kicked her. Asked how he feels now about having assaulted her, he said: 'It's not just now, I did feel bad then when I done things as well.' His barrister, Mark McKone KC, asked him about the night she died and he said he had not assaulted or hit her in any way. Mr McKone said: 'Did you do anything to Colette on the 20th of April that could have caused that brain haemorrhage?' He replied: 'Nothing at all.' He said when she got home that night she tripped on some ladders on the stairs but then got into bed and he thought she was just drunk and tired. But the next morning, he said he touched her back and she was 'ice cold'. Campbell told the court: 'I thought she was dead. I felt sick. Upset.'

423375242,"O governo Lula (PT) ignora há quase seis meses uma recomendação do Ministério Público Federal (MPF) para que o Ministério da Saúde declare emergência em saúde pública na região do rio Tapajós onde está a Terra Indígena Mundurucu, no Pará . O pedido da Procuradoria da República foi feito em razão da sistemática contaminação de indígenas por mercúrio de garimpos ilegais. A recomendação foi feita em 19 de abril de 2023. Documentos encaminhados pelo governo ao MPF mostram que uma emergência em saúde pública de interesse nacional não foi cogitada pelo ministério, conforme o conteúdo desses ofícios, enviados em junho e julho. Em um dos documentos, o Distrito Sanitário Especial Indígena (Dsei) Rio Tapajós afirmou que seria 'pouco efetiva' uma intervenção da Força Nacional do SUS, formada por profissionais de saúde e convocada em situações de emergência, como a vivida na Terra Indígena Yanomami. Neste território, houve atuação da força. O MPF recomendou que a Força Nacional do SUS seja usada para testagem da população mundurucu exposta ao mercúrio, como forma de obtenção de um 'diagnóstico minimamente concreto da gravidade da exposição'. Para o Dsei, é necessário que haja definição de protocolos e fluxo de pacientes, o que garantiria o monitoramento dos casos. Em 25 de setembro, a Procuradoria no Pará concluiu que o Ministério da Saúde não acatou as recomendações feitas. 'Não há dados sobre a realização de monitoramento dos peixes, sobre a ampliação à testagem dos níveis de mercúrio nas pessoas que vivem em áreas impactadas pelo garimpo, com a priorização de gestantes e crianças menores de cinco anos', afirmou o MPF. Também não há acompanhamento de pessoas intoxicadas pelo metal pesado, afirmou a Procuradoria. 'Percebe-se que ainda não há políticas públicas de saúde indígena bem definidas para a prevenção e o monitoramento dos indígenas cujos índices de mercúrio no organismo superam os limites recomendados pela OMS [Organização Mundial de Saúde]', cita a análise feita pelo MPF a respeito da primeira recomendação. Houve reiteração sobre a necessidade de declaração de emergência em saúde pública. A ministra da Saúde, Nísia Trindade, foi oficiada pelo MPF no dia 2 de outubro, para que explique se acatou ou não a recomendação. No último sábado (7), reportagem publicada pelo jornal 'Folha de S.Paulo' mostrou as consequências do avanço de garimpos ilegais na terra Mundurucu, a partir da entrada de escavadeiras hidráulicas de 2019 em diante. A intensidade da exploração ilegal de ouro explodiu durante o governo de Jair Bolsonaro (PL), em razão do estímulo a invasores nos territórios tradicionais. Os garimpos desorganizam as comunidades mundurucus, geram conflitos internos, engolem roças das aldeias, enlameiam os rios, despejam mercúrio na água e adoecem os indígenas, com avanço de malária e diarreia. O mais grave, porém, é o aumento de casos de crianças e mulheres com doenças neurológicas, o que pode estar conectado à intoxicação por mercúrio. Meninos e meninas mundurucus têm retardo mental grave e atraso de desenvolvimento, um quadro que pode estar associado à contaminação das mães por mercúrio e que precisa de investigação, segundo profissionais de saúde que acompanham a situação dos indígenas. Em uma das aldeias onde a reportagem esteve - a Katõ, a principal do rio Kabitutu -, três meninas, de dois a sete anos, têm 'retardo mental grave', 'atraso do desenvolvimento psicomotor' e 'transtornos globais de desenvolvimento', como consta em prontuários. As famílias recorrem a pajés da aldeia e de comunidades vizinhas em busca de respostas para a saúde das crianças. Há dificuldade de assistência médica em razão do isolamento e das distâncias - parte das famílias vai até Santarém (PA), e para isso é preciso percorrer os rios Kabitutu e Tapajós até Jacareacanga (PA), o que pode levar cinco horas, e mais 760 km até Santarém. O governo Lula vem protelando a retirada de invasores da terra Mundurucu, que circulam livremente por rios e aldeias. Garimpos cercam as comunidades e seguem ativos. Em nota, o Ministério dos Povos Indígenas (MPI) afirmou que uma desintrusão é decidida por um comitê interministerial, não somente pela pasta. 'As desintrusões envolvem ações de segurança pública, fiscalização ambiental, promoção à saúde indígena e emprego de logística militar', disse. Estão em curso três desintrusões - nas terras indígenas Yanomami, Apyterewa e Rio dos Índios - e ações preparatórias para plano de proteção da terra Vale do Javari, conforme o ministério. 'A abertura de novas frentes de ações perpassa por uma apuração mais detalhada do comitê.' A reportagem publicada foi o segundo capítulo da série 'Cerco às Aldeias', que mostra a infestação de garimpos até o quintal das comunidades. O primeiro capítulo mostrou a realidade da terra Kayapó, o território mais devastado pela exploração ilegal de ouro no país. Crateras cercam as aldeias, há conivência por parte de grupos de indígenas e cobrança de taxa para ingresso de escavadeiras. Lideranças de aldeias tentam alternativas à atividade predatória, como o crédito de carbono. No caso da terra Mundurucu, já houve um primeiro mapeamento de 111 indígenas que precisavam de atendimento médico em Santarém, em razão de problemas de saúde que podem estar associados ao mercúrio. Essas pessoas dependiam de um monitoramento de toxicidade, conforme um documento da Sesai (Secretaria de Saúde Indígena) de 2021. Os casos ficaram pelo caminho, e não houve efetivação da criação de um centro de referência para patologias decorrentes do mercúrio, previsto para funcionar em Santarém. O MPF recomendou, além da emergência em saúde pública, que as negociações para instalação do centro fossem retomadas. A Procuradoria pediu ainda um monitoramento atualizado da qualidade da água na terra Mundurucu, informações atualizadas sobre fiscalização do uso do mercúrio e um plano de descontinuidade do uso da substância na mineração artesanal. Em janeiro, o Ministério da Saúde declarou estado de emergência em saúde pública na terra Yanomami, em razão da grande quantidade de mortes de indígenas por malária e por doenças associadas à fome desnutrição, diarreia e pneumonia.

423386074,"Un adolescente israelí-estadounidense s obrevivió a un ataque de combatientes de Hamás contra su casa el fin de semana después de que sus padres lo protegieran de los disparos, pero ellos murieron durante el ataque. La familia vivía en un kibutz del sur de Israel, cerca de la frontera con Gaza. Tuvieron menos de un minuto para ponerse a salvo tras ser alertados del ataque. Cuando los atacantes invadieron su casa, se metieron en una pequeña habitación destinada a protegerlos de los ataques con cohetes. A Shlomi Mathias le volaron el brazo al intentar impedir que los combatientes entraran en la habitación, según sus familiares. Mientras los combatientes disparaban contra la habitación, Debbie Mathias gritó a su hijo Rotem que se agachara. Entonces la mataron a tiros; la bala la atravesó y le alcanzó en el estómago. Rotem Mathias, de 16 años, se tumbó debajo de su madre y se hizo el muerto durante unos 30 minutos antes de correr a refugiarse debajo de una cama y finalmente, esconderse bajo una manta en el lavadero contiguo, según dijeron sus familiares a The Associated Press. En dos ocasiones, Rotem Mathias consiguió eludir a los combatientes -algunos de ellos riéndose- antes de ser rescatado por soldados israelíes. 'Lo último que dijo mi padre es que había perdido el brazo. Luego mi madre murió encima de mí', dijo Rotem Mathias a ABC News en una entrevista desde el hospital donde estaba siendo tratado por heridas de bala y metralla. Fue dado de alta el martes. 'Simplemente detuve mi respiración. La bajé todo lo que pude. No me moví y estaba aterrorizado', dijo. 'No hice ningún ruido. Recé a cualquier dios. No me importaba qué dios. Sólo recé a un dios para que no me encontraran'. El calvario de la familia se desarrolló en un chat de grupo a primera hora de la mañana del sábado, comenzando con el mensaje de la pareja de que habían oído voces en árabe, rotura de cristales y disparos. Luego se quedaron en silencio durante 20 minutos antes de que Rotem Mathias respondiera: 'Mamá y papá están muertos, lo siento. Pide ayuda'. Durante las 10 horas siguientes, los familiares, entre ellos el cuñado de Deborah Mathias, Eran Shani, su mujer y sus hijas, apoyaron a Rotem. En un momento dado, consiguieron que un médico se uniera a la llamada para hablar con Rotem Mathias de lo que estaba pasando y de su nivel de hemorragia, para evaluar la situación. Shani contó a AP que su mujer, psicoterapeuta, intentó calmar a Rotem durante 'muchas horas antes de que llegaran los soldados. Estaba sangrando. Se rindió varias veces. No sabía si iba a sobrevivir o no'. Mientras tanto, las otras dos hijas de los Mathias, Shir, de 21 años, y Shakked, de 19, se escondían por separado en sus propias habitaciones seguras del kibbutz, a pocos minutos de sus padres. Recibieron un mensaje de su madre diciendo que había combatientes en el kibbutz y que no debían 'abrir la puerta'. 'Lo único que oíamos eran disparos, gritos, bombas y coches que explotaban', cuenta Shir Mathias, que recuerda cómo se escondió durante más de 12 horas hasta que ambas hermanas fueron rescatadas por los soldados. 'Es como si cerraras los ojos y pensaras que estás en una sala de cine. Luego abres los ojos y te das cuenta: Estoy en mi habitación. Estoy en mi casa. Esto es real', dijo a AP. 'Podíamos oír misiles volando hacia abajo. Podíamos oírlos silbar y explotar. Era una locura. Nunca había oído nada igual. Era aterrador'. Cuando oscureció, Shakked Mathias fue en busca de su hermana. 'Preparé una bolsa lo más silenciosamente que pude, corrí al apartamento de mi hermana y llamé a su puerta. Pensó que era una terrorista. La llamé por su nombre y me abrió', cuenta Shakked Mathias. 'A partir de ese momento, estuvimos juntos. Y lo primero que le pregunté fue: ¿Crees que mamá y papá están muertos? ¿Crees que nuestro hermano está bien?'. Estuvieron a punto de ser sorprendidos por combatientes de Hamás que llamaron a su puerta y alumbraron el interior con una linterna. Cuando los combatientes se marcharon, Shir Mathias empezó a llamar frenéticamente a todo el que pudo antes de ponerse en contacto con un soldado que acudió a su casa. El ataque se produjo horas después de que la familia se reuniera para celebrar la festividad judía de Sucot. Las hermanas recordaban una velada festiva que incluía música, ya que sus padres eran músicos. Shlomi Mathias era profesor de música; Debbie Mathias, cantante y compositora. Sus padres estaban nostálgicos, hablando de cómo se conocieron. La familia regresó al kibbutz, y Shir Mathias recuerda que su madre le dijo que se lo pasara bien el sábado, ya que tenían previsto asistir a un concierto de Bruno Mars en Tel Aviv. Su padre ayudó a comprobar el aceite del coche. 'Antes de irme a casa, mamá me dijo: `Adiós. Diviértete mañana', cuenta Shir Mathias. 'Yo le dije: `Gracias, te quiero’. La abracé y abracé a mi padre'. Horas después, se habían ido.",9578,un adolescente israelí estadounidense s obrevivió un ataque de combatientes de hamás contra su casa el fin de semana después de que sus padre lo protegieran de los disparos pero ellos murieron durante el ataque la familia vivía en un kibutz del sur de israel cerca de la frontera con gaza tuvieron menos de un minuto para ponerse salvo tras ser alertado del ataque cuando los atacante invadieron su casa se metieron en una pequeña habitación destinada protegerlos de los ataques con cohete shlomi mathias le volaron el brazo al intentar impedir que los combatientes entraran en la habitación según sus familiare mientras los combatiente disparaban contra la habitación debbie mathias gritó su hijo rotem que se agachara entonce la mataron tiro la bala la atravesó y le alcanzó en el estómago rotem mathias de año se tumbó debajo de su madre y se hizo el muerto durante unos minutos ante de correr refugiarse debajo de una cama y finalmente esconderse bajo una manta en el lavadero contiguo según dijeron sus familiare associated press en do ocasione rotem mathias consiguió eludir los combatientes de ellos ante de ser rescatado por soldados israelíes lo último que dijo mi padre es que había perdido el brazo luego mi madre murió encima de mí dijo rotem mathias abc news en una entrevista desde el hospital donde estaba siendo tratado por heridas de bala y metralla fue dado de alta el marte simplemente detuve mi respiración la bajé todo lo que pude moví y estaba aterrorizado dijo hice ningún ruido recé cualquier dio importaba qué dio sólo recé un dios para que encontraran el calvario de la familia se desarrolló en un chat de grupo primera hora de la mañana del sábado comenzando con el mensaje de la pareja de que habían oído vox en árabe rotura de cristale y disparo luego se quedaron en silencio durante minutos ante de que rotem mathias respondiera mamá y papá están muerto lo siento pide ayuda durante las hora siguiente los familiares entre ellos el cuñado de deborah mathias eran shani su mujer y sus hijas apoyaron rotem en un momento dado consiguieron que un médico se uniera la llamada para hablar con rotem mathias de lo que estaba pasando y de su nivel de hemorragia para evaluar la situación shani contó ap que su mujer psicoterapeuta intentó calmar rotem durante muchas hora antes de que llegaran los soldados estaba sangrando se rindió varias vece sabía si iba sobrevivir o mientras tanto las otras do hijas de los mathias shir de año y shakked de se escondían por separado en sus propias habitacione seguras del kibbutz pocos minuto de sus padre recibieron un mensaje de su madre diciendo que había combatientes en el kibbutz y que debían abrir la puerta lo único que oíamos eran disparos grito bombas y coche que explotaban cuenta shir mathias que recuerda cómo se escondió durante más de hora hasta que ambas hermanas fueron rescatadas por los soldados es como si cerraras los ojos y pensaras que estás en una sala de cine luego abre los ojos y te das cuenta estoy en mi habitación estoy en mi casa esto es real dijo ap podíamos oír misile volando hacia abajo podíamos oírlos silbar y explotar era una locura nunca había oído nada igual era aterrador cuando oscureció shakked mathias fue en busca de su hermana preparé una bolsa lo más silenciosamente que pude corrí al apartamento de mi hermana y llamé su puerta pensó que era una terrorista la llamé por su nombre y abrió cuenta shakked mathias partir de ese momento estuvimos junto y lo primero que le pregunté fue cree que mamá y papá están muerto crees que nuestro hermano está bien estuvieron punto de ser sorprendido por combatiente de hamás que llamaron su puerta y alumbraron el interior con una linterna cuando los combatiente se marcharon shir mathias empezó llamar frenéticamente todo el que pudo antes de ponerse en contacto con un soldado que acudió su casa el ataque se produjo horas después de que la familia se reuniera para celebrar la festividad judía de sucot las hermanas recordaban una velada festiva que incluía música ya que sus padre eran músicos shlomi mathias era profesor de música debbie mathias cantante y compositora sus padre estaban nostálgicos hablando de cómo se conocieron la familia regresó al kibbutz y shir mathias recuerda que su madre le dijo que se lo pasara bien el sábado ya que tenían previsto asistir un concierto de bruno mars en tel aviv su padre ayudó comprobar el aceite del coche antes de irme casa mamá dijo adiós diviértete mañana cuenta shir mathias yo le dije gracias te quiero la abracé y abracé mi padre hora después se habían ido

423355878,"Yésica Anahí Lishnivez (33), acusada de asesinar a su ex pareja y al hijo de éste tras prender fuego la vivienda de ambos en Leandro N. Alem, será juzgada mañana en la sala de audiencias del Tribunal Penal Uno de Oberá. El debate comenzará a las 8.30 y la imputada enfrenta una acusación por el delito de doble homicidio calificado, según consignaron fuentes consultadas por La Voz de Misiones. Para mañana hay siete testigos citados a prestar declaración y, de no mediar imponderables, se prevé que en la misma jornada se desarrolle la ronda de alegatos y el posterior dictado de sentencia. Esa madrugada, efectivos policiales y personal de Bomberos acudieron al lugar para sofocar un voraz incendio que consumía la vivienda y, desafortunadamente, al ingresar se toparon con los restos calcinados de padre e hijo. Al principio el caso pareció tratarse de un hecho accidental, pero tras las primeras labores los uniformados que intervinieron en el lugar percibieron olor a combustible, como así también dieron con restos de gomaespuma con líquidos inflamables. A partir de ahí, la investigación viró hacia un incendio intencional y las sospechas recayeron sobre Lishnivez, quien horas antes había mantenido una discusión con su ex pareja. La pesquisa avanzó y al recolectar más indicios en contra de la mujer las autoridades del Juzgado de Instrucción Cinco ordenaron un allanamiento en su vivienda, procedimiento en el cual los investigadores dieron con elementos similares a los encontrados en la escena del hecho y que pudieron ser utilizados para encender las llamas. Con todos estos elementos sobre el tapete, la sospechosa fue detenida y desde ese día permanece privada de su libertad. Comentarios. Clara, precisa y contundente. Los más de siete años transcurridos no fueron impedimento alguno para que Florencia Wille Bille, una testigo clave en el juicio contra Julio Werner Lutz (30), pudiera recordar y describir cada segundo vivido dentro del Ford Fiesta Kinetic con el cual el acusado embistió y mató al motociclista Fernando Vázquez (24) en agosto de 2016 sobre la ex ruta provincial 213 de Posadas. Su testimonio, al igual que el de Sabina Chávez -que declara mañana-, era aguardado con expectativas en el Salón de Usos Múltiples (SUM) del Palacio de Justicia, donde se desarrolla el juicio que comenzó ayer , dado que era una de las dos jóvenes que iban como acompañantes del imputado al momento del siniestro fatal y cuyo aporte brindado en la etapa de investigación prácticamente sentó las bases para que Werner Lutz sea acusado por el delito de 'homicidio simple' y no por 'homicidio culposo', carátula aplicada mayormente para este tipo de hechos. Y Wille Bille no cambió ninguna palabra de lo dicho anteriormente. En lágrimas por momentos y con dejos de bronca o impotencia en otros, la joven que actualmente es policía declaró esta mañana ante el Tribunal Penal Uno de Posadas y volvió a comprometer al acusado. Ante los magistrados Gustavo Bernie -presidente-, Vivana Cukla y Miguel Mattos (subrogante), la testigo recordó que aquella tarde del 20 de agosto de 2016 Werner Lutz, que era amigo de su amiga Sabina Chávez, la pasó a buscar por su casa y juntos se fueron a ver una exposición de autos en el autódromo, lugar en el cual según su estimación permanecieron dos horas. Wille Bille sostuvo que en el autódromo Werner Lutz 'consumió cerveza y fumó porro', hasta que se fueron porque el joven debía cerrar su local de celulares en el centro. Fue en ese trayecto que se produjo el siniestro fatal. 'Él salió muy fuerte. En la ruta ya pasamos un semáforo en rojo. Al llegar frente al club Centro de Cazadores el semáforo estaba en rojo. Del lado derecho había autos y del lado izquierdo estaba solo el chico de la moto, parado. Él (por Werner Lutz) no frenó. Se veía perfectamente todo, por eso le empezamos a gritar ‘el chico, el chico’, pero nunca frenó', describió la testigo y no una, sino dos veces, ante las consultas tanto del fiscal Martín Rau como de los defensores Pablo Luján y Eduardo Paredes. La joven también sostuvo que como ella iba en el asiento trasero alcanzó a ver el velocímetro del auto y afirmó ver que las agujas del tablero marcaban '130 kilómetros por hora'. Además, remarcó que 'dos o tres veces le pedimos que baje la velocidad y no bajó. Le gritamos ‘el chico, el chico’ y no frenó. Frenamos solo cuando mi amiga estiró la palanca del freno de mano'. Por último, ratificó que ellos circulaban por el carril izquierdo de la 213 -en sentido hacia a la avenida Quaranta- y que no evadieron ningún otro auto, contradiciendo la versión dada ayer por el imputado. 'Él no se preocupó por nada, solo se preocupó por su auto', lanzó casi sobre el final de su exposición y en otro asalto de lágrimas. Múltiples lesiones. Previo a su testimonio declararon otros tres testigos, entre ellos el médico Silvio Bojanovich, quien realizó la autopsia al cuerpo de la víctima y quien enumeró las lesiones que padeció Vázquez. El profesional detalló que la causa de muerte fue 'un traumatismo cráneo encefálico con compromiso vertebral que provocó una hemorragia en el cerebro, bulbo y médula', pero además de ello también sufrió múltiples fracturas costales en el tórax que derivó en un estallido de pulmón, hígado y bazo. Aportó, además, que en el impacto el joven experimentó un 'latigazo' que provocó un desnuque, secuencia de hechos que puede estar relacionada a la 'velocidad del impacto' y aseguró que el casco no puede evitar un desenlace de este tipo. Por último, declararon dos jóvenes que también estuvieron en la misma exposición de autos en el autódromo y quienes llegaron a la escena entre 5 y 10 minutos después del hecho. Uno de ellos, Eduardo Encina, recordó que mientras salían 'él nos cruzó con el auto e iba bastante rápido'. El debate. El debate oral continuará mañana, otra vez a partir de las 8.30 y en el SUM del Palacio de Justicia. Se prevé la declaración de otros seis testigos, entre ellos el de Sabina Chávez, la otra muchacha que iba en el auto del acusado al momento del siniestro. Fernando Vázquez era playero. La noche del 20 de agosto de 2016 se dirigía hacia su trabajo y aguardaba la luz verde en el semáforo a bordo de su motocicleta Yamaha YBR cuando fue embestido desde atrás por el Ford Fiesta Kinetic del acusado.

423314191,"Grande aliado na hora de lavar a louça, o paninho úmido que fica esticado na pia pode ser um grande vilão à saúde das pessoas. Isso porque ele é um grande agente proliferador de bactérias por oferecer duas principais fontes de multiplicação desses microrganismos, como: matéria orgânica (restos de alimentos presentes na cozinha) e a umidade. — O ideal é que os panos de pia sejam utilizados apenas uma vez por dia ou para, ao menos, conter agentes contra bactérias. Os panos contaminados podem oferecer risco na manipulação e contaminação de alimentos, o que pode causar danos ao homem, uma vez que as bactérias podem ter contato direto com o alimento e causar por exemplo uma diarreia — afirma a microbiologista no Richet Medicina & Diagnóstico e mestre em Pesquisa Clínica pela Fiocruz, Gabriela Castro. Em um vídeo que viralizou na internet recentemente, a nutricionista e especialista em cosméticos e produtos naturais, Márcia Marostica, também falou um pouco sobre o famoso paninho úmido sobre a pia, segundo ela, um dos objetos mais 'nojentos' que as pessoas têm em casa. Marostica relembra que um dos riscos com o pano úmido é a contaminação cruzada, ou seja, quando um alimento é infectado com bactérias provenientes de outro e acabam contaminando diretamente humanos. — Passou o paninho em cima da carne cortada pronta para ser cozida para limpá-la e depois vai cortar tomate e verduras que não devem ser cozidos, porque vão ser consumidos crus e passa o mesmo pano em cima deles.

423306753,"A mudança demográfica, no entanto, trouxe aumento da incidência e prevalência de doenças crônicas, que precisam ser observadas longitudinalmente e não com visitas pontuais a consultórios e hospitais. Como o sistema não foi atualizado frente à nova demanda, há prejuízos na efetividade de tratamentos e gastos desnecessários de recursos. Um caso bem típico, diz Martha, é o da polifarmácia – o uso de cinco ou mais medicamentos. 'Quando recebo uma população de idosos, eles tomam, em média, 16 medicações. E isso não acontece por conta da necessidade daquela pessoa, acontece por conta da desorganização do sistema. O paciente vai, de forma aguda e pontual, em vários profissionais ou em várias instituições, recebe diversas prescrições, pega aquilo tudo e toma. Polifarmácia, no idoso, significa risco de queda, de desorientação.' E, se nos anos 1960, não haveria alternativa a essa situação, hoje a tecnologia permite a construção da jornada do paciente. A implementação de prontuários eletrônicos, por exemplo, já é o primeiro passo para o cruzamento de informações e para se ter uma visão do todo. Informações úteis para o acompanhamento integrado dos problemas de saúde, mas, e talvez principalmente, para o desenho de uma estratégia de prevenção. Falar em prevenção é mandatório, principalmente num País como o Brasil, que 'ficou velho antes de ficar rico', nas palavras de Paulo Bertolucci, neurologista da Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp) que participou do debate. 'Temos de ser pragmáticos; trabalhar na prevenção é nossa única chance aqui para não explodir o orçamento.' Um bom exemplo, diz ele, é o programa de tratamento da aids. 'Ele jamais falhou, porque lá atrás alguém fez um cálculo e, para cada real investido em antiviral, se economizava R$ 3 no sistema de saúde, em tratamento das complicações.' No caso das doenças crônicas ligadas ao envelhecimento, a lógica é a mesma. Para isso, ao mesmo tempo em que o sistema de saúde precisa se reorganizar – com treinamentos e ênfase nos programas de saúde da família – é preciso investir pesado na conscientização da população. Até porque, complementa Bertolucci, o idoso é uma construção social. 'Ele é o que se espera que ele seja. Se você for esperto, mesmo sendo idoso, vai falar: ‘Ninguém vai falar o que eu sou. Eu é que vou’. E isso é o que permite você sair fazendo exercício em vez de ficar com um chinelo de chita, vendo TV.' Por fim, há o aspecto cultural. Não adianta investir em tecnologia, prevenção e até mesmo no empoderamento dos idosos, se o olhar do restante da sociedade para essa parcela da população for preconceituoso e não validar as dores e os benefícios do melhor cuidado até o fim da vida. 'Ah, tá cansado? É da idade. Ah, tá com esquecimento? Faz parte. Não, isso não faz parte e nem é comum ao envelhecimento', afirma Karina Fontão, diretora médica executiva da AstraZeneca Brasil que também participou do debate. Assim, é preciso ter um novo olhar para o idoso. 'Há experiências de pacientes com mais de 80 anos, extremamente ativos, que fizeram um transplante de medula. Por isso, se tem falta de ar, dá para tratar. Se tem uma cardiopatia, cuida também. O tratamento pode melhorar muito a qualidade de vida. E todos queremos envelhecer.'",9578,mudança demográfica entanto trouxe aumento da incidência e prevalência de doenças crônicas que precisam ser observadas longitudinalmente e não com visitas pontuais consultório e hospitais como o sistema não foi atualizado frente à nova demanda há prejuízos na efetividade de tratamento e gasto desnecessários de recursos um caso bem típico diz martha é o da polifarmácia o uso de cinco ou mais medicamento quando recebo uma população de idosos ele tomam em média medicações e isso não acontece por conta da necessidade daquela pessoa acontece por conta da desorganização sistema o paciente vai de forma aguda e pontual em vário profissionais ou em vária instituições recebe diversas prescrições pega aquilo tudo e toma polifarmácia idoso significa risco de queda de desorientação e se nos anos não haveria alternativa essa situação hoje tecnologia permite construção da jornada paciente implementação de prontuário eletrônicos por exemplo já é o primeiro passo para o cruzamento de informações e para se ter uma visão todo informações úteis para o acompanhamento integrado do problemas de saúde mas e talvez principalmente para o desenho de uma estratégia de prevenção falar em prevenção é mandatório principalmente num país como o brasil que ficou velho ante de ficar rico nas palavras de paulo bertolucci neurologista da universidade federal de são paulo unifesp que participou debate temos de ser pragmáticos trabalhar na prevenção é nossa única chance aqui para não explodir o orçamento um bom exemplo diz ele é o programa de tratamento da aid ele jamais falhou porque lá atrás alguém fez um cálculo e para cada real investido em antiviral se economizava sistema de saúde em tratamento das complicações caso das doenças crônicas ligadas ao envelhecimento lógica é mesma para isso ao mesmo tempo em que o sistema de saúde precisa se reorganizar com treinamento e ênfase nos programas de saúde da família é preciso investir pesado na conscientização da população até porque complementa bertolucci o idoso é uma construção social ele é o que se espera que ele seja se você esperto mesmo sendo idoso vai falar ninguém vai falar o que eu sou eu é que vou e isso é o que permite você sair fazendo exercício em vez de ficar com um chinelo de chita vendo tv por fim há o aspecto cultural não adianta investir em tecnologia prevenção e até mesmo empoderamento dos idosos se o olhar restante da sociedade para essa parcela da população preconceituoso e não validar dore e os benefício melhor cuidado até o fim da vida ah tá cansado é da idade ah tá com esquecimento faz parte não isso não faz parte e nem é comum ao envelhecimento afirma karina fontão diretora médica executiva da astrazeneca brasil que também participou debate assim é preciso ter um novo olhar para o idoso há experiência de paciente com mais de ano extremamente ativos que fizeram um transplante de medula por isso se tem falta de ar dá para tratar se tem uma cardiopatia cuida também o tratamento pode melhorar muito qualidade de vida e todo queremos envelhecer

423361855,"Una bi-nefrectomia necessaria per rimuovere i reni, di circa 8 chilogrammi ciascuno, è stata praticata su un uomo di 53 anni, affetto da una forma aggressiva di malattia del rene policistico (Adpkd), dall’équipe dell’Unità operativa di Urologia del Policlinico San Marco di Zingonia di Bergamo. La voluminosa massa occupava l’intero addome schiacciando gli altri organi e compromettendone la funzionalità. La malattia, che affliggeva il paziente da oltre 40 anni, lo ha reso, negli ultimi 5 anni, dipendente alla dialisi poiché i suoi reni, nel corso del tempo, si erano irreversibilmente danneggiati, non potendo più svolgere la loro funzione. Inoltre, l’aumento smodato del volume delle cisti presenti nei reni ha causato al paziente grandi sofferenze e ha avuto un impatto significativo sulla sua vita quotidiana: non riusciva a mangiare a causa della compressione dell’intestino, non poteva dormire sdraiato poiché la massa, premendo sulla vena cava, impediva il corretto afflusso di sangue al cuore e al polmone esponendo in paziente, Francesco, al rischio di scompenso cardio-respiratorio. A questo quadro, già complesso, si aggiungevano ulteriori complicanze come l’ipertensione arteriosa, il rischio di rottura delle cisti e quindi di emorragie e le infezioni delle vie urinarie. «Il rene policistico è una malattia ereditaria che, nella forma di cui era affetto il paziente (a trasmissione autosomica dominante), causa una degenerazione cistica di entrambi i reni – spiega Camil Zaatar, responsabile dell’Urologia -. In pratica il tessuto sano viene sostituito da cisti perdendo la sua funzionalità e il rene cresce ben oltre le sue dimensioni normali. E così quasi la metà dei pazienti arriva ad aver bisogno della dialisi per insufficienza renale grave». I medici del Servizio di nefrologia e dialisi del Policlinico San Marco di Zingonia, diretto da Marco Lorenz, che avevano in cura Francesco, all’aggravarsi della situazione hanno suggerito al paziente di sottoporsi all’intervento di bi-nefrectomia, ovvero la rimozione radicale dei reni malati, divenuto ormai inevitabile e non più rimandabile. «Si è trattato di un intervento molto complesso e delicato – continua Zaatar - tecnicamente una bi-nefrectomia, che avevo già praticato nel corso della mia carriera, ma non su dimensioni così anomale. Francesco, che era comprensibilmente molto intimorito, non poteva continuare a vivere in questa situazione, poiché, l’unica prospettiva futura era quella di peggiorare. Inoltre, essendo un paziente relativamente giovane, una volta asportati i reni avrebbe potuto candidarsi per il trapianto e sperare quindi in una vita migliore, senza dialisi». L’intervento ha avuto una durata di circa quattro ore: «Quando abbiamo inciso l’addome – dice ancora - ci siamo trovati davanti a una situazione che sospettavamo, ma che era oggettivamente straordinaria: i reni occupavano tutto l’addome dalle pelvi al diaframma comprimendo e dislocando gli altri organi, intestino, fegato, milza, ecc. Pesavano in totale 17 chili ed erano lunghi 48 centimetri, mentre un rene dovrebbe pesare di norma 150 grammi e misurare circa 10 centimetri di lunghezza. Inoltre, erano completamente deformati da decine e decine di cisti di tutte le dimensioni». Francesco, dopo una degenza di 15 giorni ha potuto lasciare l’ospedale bergamasco, riprendere le sue normali attività, in attesa del trapianto di reni.",9578,una bi nefrectomia necessaria rimuovere reni di circa chilogrammi ciascuno è stata praticata su un uomo di anni affetto da una forma aggressiva di malattia del rene policistico adpkd operativa di urologia del policlinico san marco di zingonia di bergamo la voluminosa massa occupava addome schiacciando gli altri organi e compromettendone la funzionalità la malattia che affliggeva il paziente da oltre anni lo ha reso negli ultimi anni dipendente alla dialisi poiché suoi reni nel corso del tempo si erano irreversibilmente danneggiati non potendo più svolgere la loro funzione inoltre smodato del volume delle cisti presenti nei reni ha causato al paziente grandi sofferenze e ha avuto un impatto significativo sulla sua vita quotidiana non riusciva mangiare causa della compressione non poteva dormire sdraiato poiché la massa premendo sulla vena cava impediva il corretto afflusso di sangue al cuore e al polmone esponendo paziente francesco al rischio di scompenso cardio respiratorio questo quadro già complesso si aggiungevano ulteriori complicanze come arteriosa il rischio di rottura delle cisti e quindi di emorragie e le infezioni delle vie urinarie il rene policistico è una malattia ereditaria che nella forma di cui era affetto il paziente trasmissione autosomica dominante causa una degenerazione cistica di entrambi reni spiega camil zaatar responsabile pratica il tessuto sano viene sostituito da cisti perdendo la sua funzionalità e il rene cresce ben oltre le sue dimensioni normali e così quasi la metà dei pazienti arriva ad aver bisogno della dialisi insufficienza renale grave medici del servizio di nefrologia e dialisi del policlinico san marco di zingonia diretto da marco lorenz che avevano cura francesco della situazione hanno suggerito al paziente di sottoporsi di bi nefrectomia ovvero la rimozione radicale dei reni malati divenuto ormai inevitabile e non più rimandabile si è trattato di un intervento molto complesso e delicato continua zaatar tecnicamente una bi nefrectomia che avevo già praticato nel corso della mia carriera ma non su dimensioni così anomale francesco che era comprensibilmente molto intimorito non poteva continuare vivere questa situazione poiché prospettiva futura era quella di peggiorare inoltre essendo un paziente relativamente giovane una volta asportati reni avrebbe potuto candidarsi il trapianto e sperare quindi una vita migliore senza dialisi ha avuto una durata di circa quattro ore quando abbiamo inciso dice ancora ci siamo trovati davanti una situazione che sospettavamo ma che era oggettivamente straordinaria reni occupavano tutto dalle pelvi al diaframma comprimendo e dislocando gli altri organi intestino fegato milza ecc pesavano totale chili ed erano lunghi centimetri mentre un rene dovrebbe pesare di norma grammi e misurare circa centimetri di lunghezza inoltre erano completamente deformati da decine e decine di cisti di tutte le dimensioni francesco dopo una degenza di giorni ha potuto lasciare bergamasco riprendere le sue normali attività attesa del trapianto di reni

423345826,"Precisamos falar sobre o alimento probiótico que cuida da saúde intestinal , acelera o metabolismo e ainda traz uma série de benefícios para o sistema imunológico e para a pele. Trata-se do kefir, ingrediente lácteo fermentado cada vez mais recomendado por nutricionistas , tanto por suas propriedades nutricionais e digestivas quanto por sua versatilidade. Ele pode ser consumido entre as refeições, no café da manhã, como sobremesa e até como jantar, caso esteja em busca de uma alimentação mais leve. No livro A Saúde Da Pele Está No Que Você Come (Ed. Zenith), a farmacêutica e nutricionista Paula Martín Clares menciona que o kefir 'contém proteínas, carboidratos, potássio, cálcio, magnésio, fósforo e vitaminas A, D e B'. Entre os benefícios para a pele , está a melhora da psoríase (doença que deixa manchas avermelhadas e faz a pele descamar). A nutricionista explica ainda que o kefir acelera o metabolismo, ajuda a regular os processos digestivos, limpa o trato gastrointestinal e regula os níveis de glicose e lipídios no sangue. 'Ele tem um alto teor de proteínas e é pouco calórico', completa a especialista. Em suas redes sociais, a nutricionista e farmacêutica Marián García (conhecida como Boticaria García) também falou sobre o alimento. 'No kefir, a fermentação é feita por leveduras e bactérias. Ele é excelente para o intestino devido à diversidade de microrganismos que contém', destaca ela, comparando o ingrediente ao iogurte natural , também muito recomendado para a saúde intestinal. A sabedoria popular associa os alimentos probióticos à saúde intestinal devido à presença de microorganismos e bactérias benéficas para a flora intestinal. Mas outro fator menos conhecido, e tão importante quanto, é o impacto dessas substâncias no metabolismo e na manutenção do peso. Isabel Dorst, médica nutricionista e membro da equipe científica de inovação da BIOMES, explica a relação: 'O microbioma intestinal compreende todos os microorganismos em nosso intestino e tem uma grande influência em nossa saúde, nossas defesas e nosso bem-estar. Inúmeros estudos científicos mostram que as bactérias intestinais são determinantes tanto para o ganho quanto para a perda de peso'. Na verdade, o que acontece é que as bactérias intestinais fragmentam os alimentos para que os nutrientes possam ser absorvidos — e cada uma delas tem uma função. Em outras palavras, os probióticos melhoram a digestão das gorduras e estimulam o consumo de energia. O kefir, em especial, também traz uma sensação de saciedade. 'Pesquisas mostram que uma dieta rica em alimentos probióticos, como o iogurte, aumenta a diversidade do microbioma e reduz a inflamação abdominal', acrescenta Martín Clares. Segundo um estudo realizado em 2013 na Universidade da Califórnia, as mulheres que consumiram probióticos em iogurtes demonstraram ter menos atividade cerebral na área relacionada ao estresse. O kefir é um alimento versátil, e pode ser consumido tanto nos intervalos das refeições — como no lanche da manhã ou da tarde para combater a inflamação que aumenta durante o dia — quanto no café da manhã. Para complementar o ingrediente, a psiconutricionista Itziar Digón aconselha combiná-lo a sementes de chia, frutas vermelhas e um toque de estévia. Existem muitas opções no mercado, mas nem todas são equivalentes. Digón dá a dica de observar o teor de açúcar e o tipo de leite contidos na fórmula.

423360312,"Bajista de un sinfín de artistas y grupos, tanto en disco como en directo, Matías Míguez da un nuevo paso al frente en su carrera con 'Tango tambor', espectáculo que traslada al escenario con extras de nueva creación su disco 'Buzz' (2021) y que comienza singladura en la Nova Jazz Cava de Terrassa el viernes , 13 de octubre. La alineación que acompaña a Míguez, argentino de 50 años, expresa el cosmopolitismo de la comunidad musical barcelonesa . Las palabras con que el bajista presenta a los músicos, por su parte, contornean las intenciones del proyecto. Al bandoneón y la trompeta, el argentino Guillermo Calliero . 'Es un trompetista excelso que hace siete años se puso a estudiar en profundidad el bandoneón -dice Míguez-. Está consiguiendo trasladar su lenguaje como 'jazzman' a ese instrumento tan complejo. Es algo que muy pocos músicos han desarrollado'. A los teclados, el ruso Artashes Aslanvan . 'Es un virtuoso capaz de tocar el jazz más difícil, pero no tiene ningún complejo a la hora de tocar sonidos más próximos a la contemporaneidad y el pop, por ejemplo un sintetizador ochentero. Y este perfil es muy difícil de encontrar'. A la guitarra eléctrica, el barcelonés Héctor Martín . 'Es guitarrista de Rambalaya, A Contra Blues, Dani Nello... Alguien absolutamente identificado con el rock and roll. Pero pocos saben que de alma es un 'jazzman', además de un fanático de Luis Salinas. Así que me va a dar a la vez la fuerza rockera y la sensibilidad bolerística que necesito'. Y a la batería, el argentino Salvador Toscano . 'Llegamos juntos a Barcelona hace 20 años. Es el más parecido a mí porque ha tocado con infinidad de artistas de los estilos más diversos'. De todo. Míguez es el bajista de Rambalaya, Los Saxofonistas Salvajes y Edu Tancredi Sextet . Además, tiene un 'satélite descomunal' de formaciones y solistas que en cualquier momento pueden requerir sus servicios. Lleva 30 años como profesional de la música, durante los que ha tocado, informa, 'desde heavy metal hasta flamenco pasando por jazz, rhythm and blues, pop... '. Es un 'sideman' , vamos. 'Pero tampoco es tan habitual que un 'sideman' transite por tantos registros tan distintos -matiza- Siempre había en mi cabeza un interrogante: por qué no he conseguido especializarme? La pregunta empezó a responderse con 'Buzz', título que alude al zumbido o murmullo del interrogante. Me di cuenta de que para explicarme necesito todo ese espectro de música, de que estoy comprometido con la gama de grises que hay entre el blanco y el negro'. Míguez considera 'absolutamente contracultural' en un sentido profundo su propuesta . 'El 'establishment' nos dice que los contenidos culturales complejos no funcionan -argumenta-, nos entrena para que no los abordemos y nos quedemos con los productos superficiales que nos da. Voy contra esto y defiendo que hemos de abordar contenidos culturales complejos. Mi música no es pretenciosa pero sí compleja: digamos que armónicamente te vas a encontrar más de cuatro acordes'. Brasil Noticias relacionadas El tango está presente en la fusión jazzística de 'Tango tambor', por supuesto, pero también lo está la música popular brasileña. 'No siento que esté siguiendo una rama de la cultura argentina -explica Míguez-, pero sí que la presencia del bandoneón siempre le va a dar un punto de tango. Y es verdad que en mi viaje musical ha dejado una huella muy importante Brasil, con la bossa nova y la música del nordeste, lo afro-bahiano . Eso se me ha metido en el cuerpo. En Argentina se exterminó a los negros. En una epidemia gigante de fiebre amarilla se los metió en un gueto y murieron muchísimos. Y después se los utilizó como primera línea en la guerra del Paraguay. Acabamos con nuestros antepasados afrodescendientes y nuestra música urbana perdió eso. Me he pasado la vida buscando ritmos del mundo que me ayudaran a decir un tango rítmico, con esa potencia que de alguna manera le fue extirpada'. El músico tiene la capacidad de improvisar y de tocar solos. Pero no es 'Tango tambor' un 'show' al servicio de su virtuosismo . Ni del de sus acompañantes. 'No creo en eso -sentencia-. Lo mejor de mí no es ser un solista desenfrenado, sino llevar el 'groove', proveer de peso, aportar dinámicas. Es una música donde la improvisación tiene su lugar, pero no es un lugar principal. Hay más composición, emocionalidad y sobre todo el mantra de los 'grooves'. Si eres músico y a los 50 años no has aprendido a dejar que la canción mande, es 'too late, baby'. La canción te lo dicta todo'.",9578,bajista de un sinfín de artista y grupos tanto en disco como en directo matías míguez da un nuevo paso al frente en su carrera con tango tambor espectáculo que traslada al escenario con extras de nueva creación su disco buzz y que comienza singladura en la nova jazz cava de terrassa el vierne de octubre la alineación que acompaña míguez argentino de año expresa el cosmopolitismo de la comunidad musical barcelonesa las palabras con que el bajista presenta los músicos por su parte contornean las intencione del proyecto al bandoneón y la trompeta el argentino guillermo calliero es un trompetista excelso que hace siete años se puso estudiar en profundidad el bandoneón está consiguiendo trasladar su lenguaje como jazzman ese instrumento tan complejo es algo que muy pocos músicos han desarrollado los teclado el ruso artashes aslanvan es un virtuoso capaz de tocar el jazz más difícil pero tiene ningún complejo la hora de tocar sonido más próximos la contemporaneidad y el pop por ejemplo un sintetizador ochentero y este perfil es muy difícil de encontrar la guitarra eléctrica el barcelonés héctor martín es guitarrista de rambalaya contra blues dani nello alguien absolutamente identificado con el rock roll pero pocos saben que de alma es un jazzman además de un fanático de luis salinas así que va dar la vez la fuerza rockera y la sensibilidad bolerística que necesito y la batería el argentino salvador toscano llegamos junto barcelona hace año es el más parecido mí porque ha tocado con infinidad de artistas de los estilos más diversos de todo míguez es el bajista de rambalaya los saxofonistas salvajes y edu tancredi sextet además tiene un satélite descomunal de formacione y solista que en cualquier momento pueden requerir sus servicio lleva años como profesional de la música durante los que ha tocado informa desde heavy metal hasta flamenco pasando por jazz rhythm blue pop es un sideman vamo pero tampoco es tan habitual que un sideman transite por tanto registros tan distintos siempre había en mi cabeza un interrogante por qué conseguido especializarme la pregunta empezó responderse con buzz título que alude al zumbido o murmullo del interrogante di cuenta de que para explicarme necesito todo ese espectro de música de que estoy comprometido con la gama de gris que hay entre el blanco y el negro míguez considera absolutamente contracultural en un sentido profundo su propuesta el establishment nos dice que los contenidos culturale complejos funcionan nos entrena para que los abordemos y nos quedemos con los productos superficiale que nos da voy contra esto y defiendo que hemos de abordar contenido culturale complejos mi música es pretenciosa pero sí compleja digamos que armónicamente te vas encontrar más de cuatro acorde brasil noticias relacionadas el tango está presente en la fusión jazzística de tango tambor por supuesto pero también lo está la música popular brasileña siento que esté siguiendo una rama de la cultura argentina pero sí que la presencia del bandoneón siempre le va dar un punto de tango y es verdad que en mi viaje musical ha dejado una huella muy importante brasil con la bossa nova y la música del nordeste lo afro bahiano eso se ha metido en el cuerpo en argentina se exterminó los negros en una epidemia gigante de fiebre amarilla se los metió en un gueto y murieron muchísimos y después se los utilizó como primera línea en la guerra del paraguay acabamos con nuestros antepasado afrodescendiente y nuestra música urbana perdió eso pasado la vida buscando ritmos del mundo que ayudaran decir un tango rítmico con esa potencia que de alguna manera le fue extirpada el músico tiene la capacidad de improvisar y de tocar solo pero es tango tambor un al servicio de su virtuosismo ni del de sus acompañante creo en eso lo mejor de mí es ser un solista desenfrenado sino llevar el groove proveer de peso aportar dinámicas es una música donde la improvisación tiene su lugar pero es un lugar principal hay más composición emocionalidad y sobre todo el mantra de los groove si ere músico y los años aprendido dejar que la canción mande es late baby la canción te lo dicta todo
423357763,"AgenPress . Oltre 1.000 persone sono state uccise e più di 1.600 ferite solo in 11 villaggi di Zinda Jan, dopo che il terremoto di magnitudo 6,3 ha colpito il 7 ottobre l’Afghanistan occidentale , insieme alle diverse forti scosse di assestamento, devastando ancora una volta le vite dei bambini e delle famiglie che stanno già affrontando molteplici crisi. Ad oggi, oltre il 90% delle vittime segnalate sono bambini e donne. E proprio questa mattina (in piena notte per l’Italia), un’altra scossa di magnitudo 6,3 ha fatto tremare le province occidentali. Il terremoto ( del 7 ottobre ) è stato devastante per i bambini e le loro famiglie che vivono in una regione già colpita da anni di conflitti e insicurezza, siccità, sfollamenti, povertà ed epidemie multiple. Tutto questo si è ora combinato, creando un’ emergenza umanitaria senza precedenti per i bambini . L’inverno si avvicina e molte famiglie, che hanno perso tutti i loro beni, hanno un bisogno ancora più pressante di vestiti caldi, ripari o modi per riscaldarsi, cucinare e accedere all’acqua potabile. Si stima che – a causa del terremoto di sabato- siano state colpite 11.585 persone (1.655 famiglie). Tre villaggi rappresentano il 93% di tutti i morti e l’88% di tutti i feriti segnalati finora . Circa 1 .320 case (95%) sono parzialmente o completamente distrutte a Zinda Jan . 693 donne e 350 bambini e bambine colpite dal terremoto sono stati trasferiti in rifugi temporanei presso il Centro di transito di Guzeraga nella città di Herat. La priorità principale dell’UNICEF è quella di fornire immediatamente servizi di protezione dei bambini, salute, nutrizione, istruzione, cambiamento dei comportamenti sociali e acqua e servizi igienici , nonché trasferimenti umanitari in denaro ai bambini e alle persone vulnerabili colpite dal terremoto. Nelle prime 72 ore di risposta , l’UNICEF e i suoi partner hanno già fornito il seguente sostegno: ha fornito 10 tende che vengono utilizzate come cliniche temporanee nei villaggi con strutture sanitarie danneggiate e 10 tende ad alte prestazioni sono state installate come spazi di apprendimento temporanei nei villaggi più colpiti; sono stati inoltre forniti 40 kit per la diarrea acquosa acuta, 1.200 scatole di cibo terapeutico pronto all’uso per il trattamento dei bambini malnutriti; oltre 5.000 persone hanno ricevuto 80.000 litri di acqua potabile e sicura tramite un trasporto di emergenza, oltre a 10.000 kit igienici e 5.000 kit familiari 875 bambini e 693 donne hanno ricevuto supporto psicosociale le strutture sanitarie sostenute dall’UNICEF in collaborazione con i partner del Progetto di risposta all’emergenza sanitaria stanno fornendo supporto per il trattamento delle persone ferite, l’assistenza ai traumi e il reindirizzamento nelle aree più colpite.",9578,agenpress oltre persone sono state uccise e più di ferite solo villaggi di zinda jan dopo che il terremoto di magnitudo ha colpito il ottobre occidentale insieme alle diverse forti scosse di assestamento devastando ancora una volta le vite dei bambini e delle famiglie che stanno già affrontando molteplici crisi ad oggi oltre il delle vittime segnalate sono bambini e donne e proprio questa mattina piena notte scossa di magnitudo ha fatto tremare le province occidentali il terremoto del ottobre è stato devastante bambini e le loro famiglie che vivono una regione già colpita da anni di conflitti e insicurezza siccità sfollamenti povertà ed epidemie multiple tutto questo si è ora combinato creando un emergenza umanitaria senza precedenti bambini si avvicina e molte famiglie che hanno perso tutti loro beni hanno un bisogno ancora più pressante di vestiti caldi ripari o modi riscaldarsi cucinare e accedere potabile si stima che causa del terremoto di siano state colpite persone famiglie tre villaggi rappresentano il di tutti morti e di tutti feriti segnalati finora circa case sono parzialmente o completamente distrutte zinda jan donne e bambini e bambine colpite dal terremoto sono stati trasferiti rifugi temporanei presso il centro di transito di guzeraga nella città di herat la priorità principale è quella di fornire immediatamente servizi di protezione dei bambini salute nutrizione istruzione cambiamento dei comportamenti sociali e acqua e servizi igienici nonché trasferimenti umanitari denaro ai bambini e alle persone vulnerabili colpite dal terremoto nelle prime ore di risposta e suoi partner hanno già fornito il seguente sostegno ha fornito tende che vengono utilizzate come cliniche temporanee nei villaggi con strutture sanitarie danneggiate e tende ad alte prestazioni sono state installate come spazi di apprendimento temporanei nei villaggi più colpiti sono stati inoltre forniti kit la diarrea acquosa acuta scatole di cibo terapeutico pronto il trattamento dei bambini malnutriti oltre persone hanno ricevuto litri di acqua potabile e sicura tramite un trasporto di emergenza oltre kit igienici e kit familiari bambini e donne hanno ricevuto supporto psicosociale le strutture sanitarie sostenute collaborazione con partner del progetto di risposta sanitaria stanno fornendo supporto il trattamento delle persone ferite ai traumi e il reindirizzamento nelle aree più colpite

423360610,"An expert has issued a stark warning to people who don't rinse their chopping board immediately after cutting vegetables, revealing the unwashed board could become a breeding ground for bacteria and pathogens. While we're all aware of the dangers of raw and undercooked meat, uncooked vegetables can also lead to health problems. Research has shown that c hopping boards harbour 200% more faecal bacteria than toilet seats and potatoes and leeks can give people food poisoning. The study also revealed uncleaned chopping boards contained harmful bacteria including E.coli, according to The Daily Mail. Dr Lisa Ackerley, food hygiene expert and Global Hygiene Council representative, said: 'In all surveys I have ever done focusing on the home, chopping boards come out really badly, the reason being because people don't clean them properly.' 'People pay lots of attention to the toilet, using lots of disinfectant and think that is the dirtiest place in the house. But nearly every study I have been a part of, it is the kitchen where the most dangerous bacteria lurks. Raw meat, raw vegetables and poultry are the culprits.' Experts speaking to the Huffington Post revealed raw potatoes prove to be the most dangerous as they contain pathogens, which lead to diseases and illnesses such as gastric distress and diarrhea. It can be found in soil or as a result of animal manure improperly composted. Once a potato is plucked from the soil, and brought into the kitchen, pathogenic microorganisms can spread onto household items such as a chopping board. Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts professor Julian Bond shared: 'Chopping potatoes that you haven't washed properly, and you just wipe the board before go on to chop your chicken. It's a breeding ground for bacteria and pathogens.' Meanwhile, Donald Schaffner, food science department chair at Rutgers University, added: 'The pathogenic microorganisms associated with raw potatoes would be any that are found in and survive in the dirt. The primary ones that I would be worried about would be spore-forming pathogens like Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium perfringens.' Do you have a story to sell?

423391543,"Una familia en Bogotá vive una doble tragedia tras la trágica muerte de Ángel Santiago Maecha , un niño de tan solo siete años. El fatídico accidente tuvo lugar el pasado sábado, 7 de octubre, en el cementerio Jardines del Apogeo , ubicado al sur de Bogotá, mientras la familia visitaba la tumba de otro ser querido, quien había sido enterrada pocos días antes. Según los informes, mientras se preparaban para abandonar el cementerio después de rendir homenaje a su ser querido, la rama de un árbol se desprendió y cayó sobre Ángel, arrojándolo contra una lápida en el suelo. Este trágico accidente le provocó una grave herida en la cabeza que resultó en su muerte inmediata. Vanessa, tía del niño, compartió con el programa radial ‘Cómo Amaneció Bogotá’, de la emisora ‘Tropicana’, los angustiosos momentos que vivieron después de la impactante tragedia. Según manifestó la mujer, la familia había estado visitando a su abuelita, cuyas cenizas habían sido sepultadas el 4 de octubre. No obstante, su visita al cementerio para limpiar la tumba y ofrecer una oración en honor a la fallecida se convirtió en un desgarrador giro del destino. Vanessa relató: “El 4 de octubre enterramos las cenizas de mi abuela. Venimos de una tragedia a otra tragedia . Fuimos el sábado a lavar la lápida, ya que quedó llena de tierra. Fuimos, le hicimos una oración y cuando mi papá dijo: ‘vamos a almorzar’, íbamos caminando en fila y cayó el palo”. De acuerdo con lo que reveló la mujer, la rama del árbol cayó con gran fuerza. “Vino con gran velocidad, a más de 20 metros de altura, le cayó en el pechito , lo empujó y él cayó encima de una lápida, le atravesó el cráneo con el filo, y murió instantáneamente. La familia reaccionó rápidamente, buscando ayuda y trasladando al pequeño al hospital en su propio vehículo. En el camino, se encontraron con una ambulancia que los asistió en los esfuerzos de reanimación . Sin embargo, la herida del niño resultó ser devastadora. “Lo primero que hicimos fue coger al niño y subirnos al carro. Llegando al Perdomo, vi una ambulancia, me bajé del carro con el niño, me ayudaron y comenzaron con la reanimación mientras la otra enfermera vendaba para calmar la hemorragia, la cual nunca se calmó, ni siquiera en el hospital; le destrozó toda su cabecita”, contó la mujer. En el hospital, los médicos confirmaron a la familia de Ángel que su muerte había sido instantánea debido a la gravedad de la herida en la cabeza. La tía del niño también aprovechó la oportunidad para denunciar la supuesta negligencia por parte del personal del cementerio , no solo en la atención de la emergencia, sino también por presuntamente haber alterado la escena del accidente. “Yo no demando porque se cayó la rama, ya que es una tragedia ambiental que nadie puede evitar. (...) Denuncio el momento en que salí con mi niño en brazos pidiendo ayuda y nadie del cementerio se acercó, nadie nos prestó los primeros auxilios ni nada”, explicó Vanessa. Y agregó: “ellos alteraron la escena porque en la noche llegó la Fiscalía al hospital, se fue con mi papá a la escena a mirarlo todo. Pero, ¿qué hizo el cementerio ese mismo sábado? Quitaron la rama y la administradora nunca llegó. Menos mal que mis familiares que se quedaron allí grabaron todo de cómo quedó, porque de lo contrario, se lavarían las manos porque alteraron la escena con botar la rama”.",9578,una familia en bogotá vive una doble tragedia tras la trágica muerte de ángel santiago maecha un niño de tan solo siete años el fatídico accidente tuvo lugar el pasado sábado de octubre en el cementerio jardines del apogeo ubicado al sur de bogotá mientras la familia visitaba la tumba de otro ser querido quien había sido enterrada pocos días ante según los inform mientras se preparaban para abandonar el cementerio después de rendir homenaje su ser querido la rama de un árbol se desprendió y cayó sobre ángel arrojándolo contra una lápida en el suelo este trágico accidente le provocó una grave herida en la cabeza que resultó en su muerte inmediata vanessa tía del niño compartió con el programa radial cómo amaneció bogotá de la emisora tropicana los angustiosos momentos que vivieron después de la impactante tragedia según manifestó la mujer la familia había estado visitando su abuelita cuyas cenizas habían sido sepultada el de octubre obstante su visita al cementerio para limpiar la tumba y ofrecer una oración en honor la fallecida se convirtió en un desgarrador giro del destino vanessa relató el de octubre enterramos las cenizas de mi abuela venimos de una tragedia otra tragedia fuimos el sábado lavar la lápida ya que quedó llena de tierra fuimos le hicimos una oración y cuando mi papá dijo vamo almorzar íbamos caminando en fila y cayó el palo de acuerdo con lo que reveló la mujer la rama del árbol cayó con gran fuerza vino con gran velocidad más de metro de altura le cayó en el pechito lo empujó y él cayó encima de una lápida le atravesó el cráneo con el filo y murió instantáneamente la familia reaccionó rápidamente buscando ayuda y trasladando al pequeño al hospital en su propio vehículo en el camino se encontraron con una ambulancia que los asistió en los esfuerzos de reanimación sin embargo la herida del niño resultó ser devastadora lo primero que hicimos fue coger al niño y subirnos al carro llegando al perdomo vi una ambulancia bajé del carro con el niño ayudaron y comenzaron con la reanimación mientras la otra enfermera vendaba para calmar la hemorragia la cual nunca se calmó ni siquiera en el hospital le destrozó toda su cabecita contó la mujer en el hospital los médicos confirmaron la familia de ángel que su muerte había sido instantánea debido la gravedad de la herida en la cabeza la tía del niño también aprovechó la oportunidad para denunciar la supuesta negligencia por parte del personal del cementerio solo en la atención de la emergencia sino también por presuntamente haber alterado la escena del accidente yo demando porque se cayó la rama ya que es una tragedia ambiental que nadie puede evitar denuncio el momento en que salí con mi niño en brazos pidiendo ayuda y nadie del cementerio se acercó nadie nos prestó los primeros auxilios ni nada explicó vanessa y agregó ellos alteraron la escena porque en la noche llegó la fiscalía al hospital se fue con mi papá la escena mirarlo todo pero qué hizo el cementerio ese mismo sábado quitaron la rama y la administradora nunca llegó menos mal que mis familiare que se quedaron allí grabaron todo de cómo quedó porque de lo contrario se lavarían las manos porque alteraron la escena con botar la rama

423352752,"The major news headlines of the day and more. October 11, 2023 07:29 pm | Updated 07:29 pm IST. Smoke rises following Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City on October 11, 2023. | Photo Credit: AP. As the war between Israel and Hamas grows intense, the Indian Embassy in Israel has set up a 24-hour helpline desk for the citizens stranded there and has asked them to follow the security advisories. The Indian Embassy announced the helpline numbers +972-35226748 and +972-543278392 for Indians who need assistance amid the ongoing conflict or wish to register with the Embassy. Meanwhile, Gaza’s only power plant has run out of fuel, forcing it to shut down after Israel cut off supplies, the Energy Ministry said on October 11. That will leave only generators to power the territory. The blackouts come as Israel has decided to block fuel shipments into the Gaza Strip as part of what the Israeli government has called a 'complete siege' on the territory run by the Hamas militant group. The Election Commission of India on October 11 announced a change in the polling date for the upcoming Rajasthan Assembly elections. The elections, which were scheduled for November 23, will now take place on November 25. 'Representations have been received in the Commission from various political parties, social organisations and also issues raised in various media platforms for change of date of poll considering large scale wedding/social engagement on that day which may cause inconvenience to large number of people, various logistic issues and may lead to reduced voters participation during poll,' the notification said. India on October 11 said a multilateral rules-based international order, along with sincere respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity remains the foundation for reviving the Indian Ocean as a strong community, in a veiled attack on China which is flexing its muscles in the region. Speaking at the 23rd Council of Ministers Meeting of the Indian Ocean Rim Association in Colombo, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also said that it is important to maintain the Indian Ocean as a free, open and inclusive space based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas, as the Constitution of the Seas. A Division Bench of two women judges of the Supreme Court on Wednesday were split in their opinions about the decision of a married woman to abort her 26-week pregnancy and the Centre’s resolve to save the 'unborn child'. Unable to reach common ground, Justices Hima Kohli and B.V. Nagarathna finally referred the case to the Chief Justice of India to form a three-judge Bench. A Delhi court on October 11 summoned BJP leader Syed Shahnawaz Hussain on a woman’s complaint alleging rape and criminal intimidation. The court took cognisance of the alleged offence and directed the former Union Minister to appear before it on October 20. 'This court after going through the cancellation report, protest petition filed by the complainant, the reply to the protest petition filed by the IO and other material on record is of the view that the complainant has given consistent statements to the police, to the court in her application and before the Ld. Magistrate in her statement u/s 164 Cr.PC,' the judge said. The Central Bureau of Investigation on October 11 conducted searches on the premises of NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha after registering a case alleging violation of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. The move comes a day after a Patiala House court sent Mr. Purkayastha and the website’s human resources head Amit Chakraborty to 10 days of judicial custody in the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act case registered by the Delhi police. Tightening its noose around the unlawful and anti-national activities of the Popular Front of India, the National Investigation Agency on October 11 conducted raids across six States against the suspects linked to the banned outfit in connection with Bihar’s Phulwari Sharif case. The searches were underway since morning at over a dozen locations in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi-NCR based on inputs against suspects. Uttar Pradesh has permitted the resumption of most production at a factory owned by Marion Biotech, which produced cough syrups Uzbekistan linked to the deaths of 65 children last year, an order seen by Reuters shows. The firm is among three Indian companies whose cough syrups the World Health Organization and other agencies have linked to the deaths of 141 children in Uzbekistan, Gambia and Cameroon, in one of the world’s worst such waves of poisoning. PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on October 11 alleged that she was prevented from leaving her home in view of President Droupadi Murmu’s visit to Jammu and Kashmir . 'Shocked to know that I can’t even step out of the house to my party office only because the Hon’ble President is visiting Srinagar today. The right of movement is snapped at a whim anytime,' Ms. Mufti said in a post on X. Reacting to news reports that audit officials of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who had exposed corruption in the Ayushman Bharat scheme and Dwarka Expressway project, have been transferred, the Congress on October 11 accused the Narendra Modi government of intimidating the officials, and demanded their reinstatement. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, alleged that the Narendra Modi government threatens and removes anyone who 'exposes' it. Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist Shahid Latif, believed to be the mastermind of the 2016 attack on an Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, was gunned down on October 11 by unidentified assailants in a mosque in Daska town of Pakistan’s Sialkot district, officials said. Latif, alias Bilal, a designated terrorist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is learnt to have been shot dead along with two of his associates by three gunmen. Vladimir Putin will visit Kyrgyzstan on October 12, the presidential office of the Central Asian country said, in what would be the Russian leader’s first known trip abroad since the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest. 'At the invitation of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Sadyr Japarov, on October 12 of this year, the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, will make an official visit to the country,' the Kyrgyz presidential administration said in a statement on its website. Sri Lanka on October 11 welcomed China’s tentative agreement to a debt restructure, as the island nation works to restore its ruined finances after suffering its worst-ever economic crisis. The government defaulted on its $46 billion debt last year at a time when months of food and fuel shortages were making life a misery for Sri Lanka’s 22 million people. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif will reach Pakistan in a chartered plane from Dubai on October 21, ending his four-year-long self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom, according to a media report. The flight carrying Nawaz will have the name 'Umeed-e-Pakistan' which can carry approximately 150 passengers, Geo News reported. 'The booking has been made and all arrangements are in place,' the report said. The 73-year-old three-time Prime Minister is expected to lead his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party in the general elections likely to be held in January next year. India has a high debt like that of China but the risks associated with it are not as great as that of its northern neighbour, a senior official from the International Monetary Fund has said, advising India in the medium term to have an ambitious fiscal consolidation plan that brings down deficits. 'The current debt in India is also high. It stands at 81.9% of GDP. Compared to China, which is 83%, it is very similar. Also, when we compare India’s debt to the pre-pandemic level in 2019, it was 75%. So it is still quite a bit higher,' Ruud de Mooij, Deputy Director, Fiscal Affairs Department at International Monetary Fund, said. Mohammed Rizwan will fondly remember the local curator in his prayers for producing a batting beauty that helped him smash a ton and guide his team to a comfortable six-wicket win against Sri Lanka in a record-breaking chase in the World Cup. The deeply religious keeper-batter scored an unbeaten 131 off 121 balls as Pakistan’s 345 for 4 is the highest successful run-chase in the history of World Cup. 'When we got to the ground for the first time, he (curator) said, ‘Rizwan, you must hit two 100s on this ground’. I met him today as well. We can pray for him and you should pray for him too,' Rizwan said at the post-match press conference as Pakistan team ended its two-week Hyderabad leg on a high with two wins in two games.

423369857,"In an interview with dvm360 at the Fetch Coastal conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Ashley Kinsley, CVT, explained how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can present differently in dogs and cats with oftentimes different symptoms. She also explained how every patient diagnosed with IBD can react differently to treatment, making it challenging to work with. The following is a partial transcript of the video. Ashley Kinsley, CVT: It is the same in that it is inflammation of the intestine, stomach, or the colon. So it kind of goes for both cats and dogs. In terms of cats, we tend to see more weight loss with them. They sometimes don't have the other symptoms and signs like diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy—dogs tend to have a lot of those things. Diagnosing IBD is pretty mu ch patient case by case. Not all cats and dogs are going to react the same way to diets to medications to other therapies.

423386432,"Ben An will think twice next time he’s buying cough medicine. The 32-year-old South Korean native has been suspended for three months for violating the PGA Tour’s Anti-Doping Policy. The Tour announced on Wednesday that An had tested positive for a substance prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) contained in a cough medicine available over the counter in his native Korea. An’s suspension officially began on Aug. 31, which means he will be eligible to return to competition on Dec. 1. According to a statement issued by the Tour, he has cooperated fully with the Tour throughout the process and accepted his suspension. As per Tour policy, the Tour said they would have no further comment on the suspension at this time. An is a former winner of the U.S. Amateur and has won on the DP World Tour but is still seeking his first PGA Tour title. An, who has represented the International Team in the Presidents Cups, lost his card after the 2020-2021 season but won on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2022 and made it to the BMW Championship, the second of three FedEx Cup events this season. At No. 44 in the FedEx Cup standings, he already is exempt into all of the signature events in 2024.

423379840,"FILE - Byeong Hun An hits from the rough on the seventh hole during the third round of the St. Jude Championship golf tournament Saturday, Aug. 12, 2023, in Memphis, Tenn. An has been suspended three months for violating the PGA Tour’s Anti-Doping Policy for a substance found in cough medicine sold over the counter in South Korea. The PGA Tour announced the three-month suspension Wednesday, Oct. 11. (AP Photo/George Walker IV, File) PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Byeong Hun An has been suspended for violating the PGA Tour’s anti-doping policy because of a banned substance found in cough medicine sold over the counter in South Korea. The PGA Tour announced the three-month suspension Wednesday and said the 32-year-old An cooperated during the process and accepted his suspension. He is believed to be the eighth player suspended since the PGA Tour began drug testing in 2008, and the first since Matt Every in 2019. An finished 44th in the FedEx Cup this year, so he is qualified for all of the $20 million signature events in 2024. The suspension is retroactive to Aug. 31, meaning he will be eligible to return on Dec. 1. He has not played since the BMW Championship in August. The FedEx Cup fall swing is primarily for players trying to secure their PGA Tour cards for next season.

423372599,"Un operativo contra el licor adulterado en Medellín, Antioquia, permitió la incautación de 19.500 litros de insumos para la falsificación de bebidas embriagantes de marcas nacionales y extranjeras. También fueron desmantelados dos alambiques ilegales que funcionaban en viviendas de las comunas de Aranjuez y La Candelaria. El operativo fue realizado por el Grupo Operativo de la Gobernación de Antioquia y la Policía Nacional , quienes encontraron elementos se encuentran tapas, estampillas, envases tipo tetra pack, botellas y empaques de reconocidas marcas de whiskey y tequila que se iban a distribuir en Antioquia, incluyendo Medellín. Adicionalmente, según comentó Óscar Mauricio Usme , director Operativo de la Secretaría de Hacienda de Antioquia, las autoridades también encontraron en sus visitas de inspección, vigilancia y control 365 unidades de licor adulterado que ya estaban listas para su comercialización. 'Es importante recordarle a los ciudadanos y a los comerciantes identificar qué tipo de productos están adquiriendo tanto para comercializar como para su consumo, porque estos productos pueden ser perjudiciales para la salud, pero además atentan contra las rentas ingresos del departamento', dijo el funcionario. Te puede interesar: Magistrados de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos en Colombia: este es el motivo de su visita Esas unidades de licor adulterado fueron encontradas en dos establecimientos que serán sancionados por cierres hasta por 30 días. Así mismo, la Policía capturó a dos personas que presuntamente iban a ser las responsables de vender esas bebidas falsificadas. 'Estos resultados se deben al trabajo conjunto con organismos de seguridad y justicia, a través del cual se nota el esfuerzo de estas entidades en cuanto a los puntos identificados y en los procedimientos que se realizaron en estos barrios de Medellín', agregó Usme. La Gobernación de Antioquia le hizo un llamado a la ciudadanía recordando la importancia de revisar el tipo de licor adquirido, tanto para su consumo como para su comercialización. El licor adulterado no solamente puede ser altamente perjudicial para quienes lo consuman, sino que su venta afecta las finanzas de los departamentos, que invierten los recursos de la venta de licor en programas de salud y educación. Por tal motivo, las autoridades recomiendan comprar licor en lugares autorizados, no confiarse de los licores que se venden a precios más baratos de lo normal, verificar que el líquido no tenga impurezas y verificar que los envases estén en buen estado. Consumir licor adulterado puede traer graves consecuencias, como ceguera completa o parcial, secuelas neurológicas severas, problemas hepáticos, lesión renal que puede requerir diálisis, intoxicación aguda e incluso la muerte. Algunos de los síntomas por el consumo de bebidas adulteradas son dolor de cabeza intenso, dilatación de las pupilas, visión borrosa, dolor abdominal, dificultad para respirar, vómito, convulsiones De acuerdo con la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) , el licor adulterado produce 3,3 millones de muertes al año en todo el mundo, lo cual significa el 5,9% de las causas de muerte. Su producción es el resultado de una mezcla de alcoholes para buscar un sabor parecido al del licor original. La diferencia radica en el proceso de destilado de las materias primas, llegando incluso a utilizar metanol (un alcohol industrial) para rendir los productos. El alcohol etílico, o etanol, es el componente que se usa frecuentemente para la fabricación de alcohol, en vez del metanol. El metanol es muy agresivo para el organismo, pero dentro de las primeras cinco o seis horas se puede realizar un lavado gástrico para evitar mayores complicaciones.",9578,un operativo contra el licor adulterado en medellín antioquia permitió la incautación de litros de insumos para la falsificación de bebidas embriagantes de marcas nacionales y extranjeras también fueron desmantelado dos alambique ilegale que funcionaban en viviendas de las comunas de aranjuez y la candelaria el operativo fue realizado por el grupo operativo de la gobernación de antioquia y la policía nacional quiene encontraron elemento se encuentran tapas estampilla envase tipo tetra pack botella y empaque de reconocidas marcas de whiskey y tequila que se iban distribuir en antioquia incluyendo medellín adicionalmente según comentó óscar mauricio usme director operativo de la secretaría de hacienda de antioquia las autoridades también encontraron en sus visitas de inspección vigilancia y control unidade de licor adulterado que ya estaban lista para su comercialización es importante recordarle los ciudadanos y los comerciantes identificar qué tipo de productos están adquiriendo tanto para comercializar como para su consumo porque estos productos pueden ser perjudiciale para la salud pero además atentan contra las rentas ingresos del departamento dijo el funcionario te puede interesar magistrados de la corte interamericana de derechos humanos en colombia este es el motivo de su visita esas unidade de licor adulterado fueron encontradas en dos establecimientos que serán sancionado por cierre hasta por días así mismo la policía capturó do personas que presuntamente iban ser las responsable de vender esas bebidas falsificadas estos resultado se deben al trabajo conjunto con organismos de seguridad y justicia través del cual se nota el esfuerzo de estas entidade en cuanto los puntos identificado y en los procedimientos que se realizaron en esto barrio de medellín agregó usme la gobernación de antioquia le hizo un llamado la ciudadanía recordando la importancia de revisar el tipo de licor adquirido tanto para su consumo como para su comercialización el licor adulterado solamente puede ser altamente perjudicial para quiene lo consuman sino que su venta afecta las finanzas de los departamentos que invierten los recursos de la venta de licor en programas de salud y educación por tal motivo las autoridades recomiendan comprar licor en lugare autorizado confiarse de los licores que se venden precio más baratos de lo normal verificar que el líquido tenga impureza y verificar que los envase estén en buen estado consumir licor adulterado puede traer grave consecuencia como ceguera completa o parcial secuelas neurológicas severas problemas hepáticos lesión renal que puede requerir diálisis intoxicación aguda e incluso la muerte algunos de los síntomas por el consumo de bebidas adulteradas son dolor de cabeza intenso dilatación de las pupilas visión borrosa dolor abdominal dificultad para respirar vómito convulsiones de acuerdo con la organización mundial de la salud oms el licor adulterado produce millone de muerte al año en todo el mundo lo cual significa el de las causas de muerte su producción es el resultado de una mezcla de alcohole para buscar un sabor parecido al del licor original la diferencia radica en el proceso de destilado de las materias primas llegando incluso utilizar metanol un alcohol industrial para rendir los productos el alcohol etílico o etanol es el componente que se usa frecuentemente para la fabricación de alcohol en vez del metanol el metanol es muy agresivo para el organismo pero dentro de las primeras cinco o seis horas se puede realizar un lavado gástrico para evitar mayore complicacione
423363347,"On estime qu’une femme meurt toutes les deux minutes de causes liées à la grossesse ou à l’accouchement, déplore l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) qui publie mercredi, sa première feuille de route pour lutter contre l’hémorragie du post-partum (HPP) qui entraîne environ 70.000 décès chaque année. Bien qu’elle soit évitable et traitable, l’HPP - définie comme des saignements excessifs après l’accouchement- est un problème qui représente la principale cause de décès maternels dans le monde. Chez les survivantes, elle peut causer des handicaps et des traumatismes psychologiques qui durent des années, précise l'OMS, dans un communiqué. «Les hémorragies sévères pendant l’accouchement sont l’une des causes les plus courantes de mortalité maternelle, bien qu’elles soient tout à fait évitables et traitables», a déclaré le Directeur général de l’OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cité dans le communiqué, précisant que cette nouvelle feuille de route fixe le cap vers un monde où davantage de femmes accouchent en toute sécurité et vivent ensuite en bonne santé avec leur famille». Selon l'OMS, les avancées obtenues dans la réduction de ces pertes sont minimes depuis 2015, et le monde n’est pas en voie d’atteindre les cibles connexes des objectifs de développement durable. En effet, le but de la feuille de route, est d’aider les pays à agir pour réduire les profondes disparités observées entre eux en matière de taux de survie, qui découlent elles-mêmes d’inégalités d’accès criantes aux services de santé essentiels. Elaborée à la suite de larges consultations auxquelles ont participé plus de 130 experts issus de différents domaines, la feuille de route pour lutter contre l’hémorragie du post-partum entre 2023 et 2030 fixe une série d’objectifs et d’activités en matière de recherche, de normes, de mise en £uvre et de plaidoyer. Les mesures prioritaires consistent à élaborer de nouvelles orientations sur l’hémorragie du post-partum, qui soient de plus vaste portée et couvrent la prévention, la détection et le traitement, à mener des recherches en vue d’innover et de renforcer l’accès à des interventions éprouvées, entre autres. De nombreux facteurs de risque peuvent être maîtrisés si des soins prénatals de qualité sont en place, notamment moyennant un accès à l’échographie, et si un suivi efficace est instauré dans les heures qui suivent la naissance. «Chaque femme, où qu’elle vive, devrait avoir accès à des soins de maternité de qualité, fournis en temps opportun et fondés sur les services de soignants qualifiés et la disponibilité du matériel essentiel et de produits adaptés et efficaces. C’est un élément essentiel pour traiter les saignements du post-partum et réduire les décès maternels», a déclaré pour sa part, Pascale Allotey, Directrice du Département Santé sexuelle et reproductive de l’OMS et du HRP, le programme spécial des Nations Unies en matière de recherche, de développement et de formation à la recherche en reproduction humaine. Selon l'Agence sanitaire mondiale, plus de 85 % des décès dus à l’HPP surviennent en Afrique subsaharienne et en Asie du Sud. Les facteurs de risque sont, en particulier, l’anémie, les anomalies placentaires et d’autres complications de la grossesse telles que les infections et la prééclampsie.",9578,estime femme meurt toute les deux minute de cause liées à la grossesse ou à déplore mondiale de la santé oms qui publie mercredi sa première feuille de route pour lutter contre du post partum hpp qui entraîne environ décè chaque année bien soit évitable et traitable définie comme des saignement excessifs après est un problème qui représente la principale cause de décè maternel dan le monde chez les survivante elle peut causer des handicap et des traumatisme psychologique qui durent des années précise dans un communiqué les hémorragie sévère pendant sont des cause les plus courante de mortalité maternelle bien soient tout à fait évitables et traitable déclaré le directeur général de tedros adhanom ghebreyesus cité dans le communiqué précisant que cette nouvelle feuille de route fixe le cap ver un monde où davantage de femme accouchent en toute sécurité et vivent ensuite en bonne santé avec leur famille selon les avancées obtenue dans la réduction de ces pertes sont minimes depuis et le monde pa en voie les cible connexe des objectifs de développement durable en effet le de la feuille de route est les pay à agir pour réduire les profonde disparités observées entre eux en matière de taux de survie qui découlent elle même criantes aux services de santé essentiel elaborée à la suite de large consultation auxquelles ont participé plus de expert issus de différent domaine la feuille de route pour lutter contre du post partum entre et fixe une série et en matière de recherche de norme de mise en uvre et de plaidoyer les mesure prioritaire consistent à élaborer de nouvelles orientation sur du post partum qui soient de plus vaste portée et couvrent la prévention la détection et le traitement à mener des recherche en vue et de renforcer à des intervention éprouvées entre autre de nombreux facteurs de risque peuvent être maîtrisés si des soin prénatal de qualité sont en place notamment moyennant un accès à et si un suivi efficace est instauré dans les heure qui suivent la naissance chaque femme où vive devrait avoir accè à des soins de maternité de qualité fournis en temps opportun et fondés sur les service de soignant qualifiés et la disponibilité du matériel essentiel et de produits adaptés et efficace un élément essentiel pour traiter les saignement du post partum et réduire les décè maternel déclaré pour sa pascale allotey directrice du département santé sexuelle et reproductive de et du hrp le programme spécial des nations unies en matière de recherche de développement et de formation à la recherche en reproduction humaine selon sanitaire mondiale plus de des décès dus à surviennent en afrique subsaharienne et en asie du sud les facteur de risque sont en particulier les anomaly placentaire et complication de la grossesse telle que les infection et la prééclampsie
423355662,"'Vimos claramente al chico en la motocicleta parado en el semáforo, le gritamos (a Lutz) con mi amiga: ‘¡La moto, la moto, frená, frená!’'. Una de las jóvenes que acompañaba a Julio Werner Lutz en el Ford Fiesta que colisionó por detrás a Fernando Fabián Vázquez (24) y causó su muerte durante la noche del sábado 20 de agosto de 2016 sobre la avenida Alicia Moreau de Justo, declaró ayer durante la segunda jornada del juicio oral y público ante el Tribunal Penal 1 de esta capital. Florencia Wille Bille tiene 27 años y hoy es policía de profesión. Siete años después del siniestro vial de la ex ruta 213 frente al club Centro de Cazadores, se sentó a declarar como testigo clave del impacto que le quitó la vida al joven motociclista y empleado que, a las 21.30 del día mencionado, se dirigía a iniciar su turno en una estación de servicios en el cruce de las avenidas San Martín y Chacabuco. Señaló que acompañó a su amiga Sabina Yanette Chávez al encuentro de automóviles de exposición que se celebraba esa tarde y noche en el autódromo de Posadas. 'Me pasaron a buscar por mi casa Sabina y Lutz en su automóvil'. Ante los jueces Viviana Gladis Cukla, Gustavo Arnaldo Bernie y Miguel Mattos, la suboficial de la Policía de Misiones coincidió en sus relatos volcados al expediente en la etapa de instrucción de la causa en manos del juez Marcelo Cardozo y la fiscal Amalia Spinnato. 'En el autódromo estuvimos menos de dos horas, porque yo tenía que volver a cuidar a mi hermanito y Lutz estaba apurado porque tenía que cerrar su negocio en el centro'. También recordó que durante ese lapso de tiempo 'Lutz compró cervezas, tomó y también lo vi fumando un porro, ya estaba pasado cuando salimos'. Amplió que al salir del autódromo aceleró el Ford Fiesta y sintió miedo porque Lutz 'comenzó a pasar semáforos en rojo cuando llegamos a la avenida 213 (…) Miré el velocímetro y vi que iba a 130 kilómetros por hora. La música estaba fuerte pero yo estaba sentada en el asiento de atrás pero al medio y nos escuchábamos, mucho más cuando comenzamos a pedirle que bajara la velocidad. Al menos tres veces se lo pedimos (…) Vimos el semáforo en rojo, íbamos en el carril izquierdo y estaba parado el muchacho con la moto. En el carril derecho había varios autos y como no frenaba comencé a gritarle ‘el chico, el chico’, pero no frenó, no frenó' Hasta este punto Wille Bille contuvo las lágrimas. Hizo silencio, agachó la cabeza varios segundos y la levantó de repente para continuar su testimonio: 'Él no frenó. El no frenó', lo repitió enfática. 'Fue mi amiga la que detuvo el auto, ella accionó la palanca del freno de mano porque él no iba frenar'. Sobre los instantes posteriores, la joven remarcó los movimientos de Lutz: 'Únicamente se preocupó por cómo quedó su auto, ni por el muchacho, ni por nosotras se preocupó. Me lastimé el hombro, una pierna y me entró vidrio en el ojo'. Mientras Wille Bille y su amiga estaban shockeadas por el impacto fueron asistidas por dos jóvenes que llegaron al lugar en un Peugeot 206, quienes las conocían y también participaron en la exposición de automóviles del autódromo. Denis Vittorio Vuotto (26) , declaró ayer sobre el fatídico episodio. Sostuvo: 'Cuando salimos del autódromo este señor (Lutz) nos pasó a alta velocidad, no era una velocidad normal pero tampoco era extremadamente rápido. Diez o quince minutos después llegamos al lugar del choque (Moreau de Justo y Las Américas) y vimos a las chicas lastimadas y las quisimos llevar al hospital. Las subimos al auto y en el cruce de la avenida San Martín y Santa Cruz nos cruzamos con la mamá de una de ellas (Chávez) y se pasaron de auto y se fueron'. TRIBUNAL PENAL1. Viviana Gladis Cukla (vocal), Gustavo Arnaldo Bernie (presidente) y Miguel Mattos (vocal subrogante). Causa de muerte. La audiencia de debate de ayer se abrió con las conclusiones de la autopsia a Fernando Vázquez. Silvio Orlando Mauricio Bojanovich , integrante del Cuerpo Médico Forense del Superior Tribunal de Justicia, explicó las lesiones detectadas en el joven de 24 años: 'Hemorragia en el cerebro por fractura en la médula espinal, traumatismo en el pecho con hemotórax, estallido de sangre en los pulmones, traumatismo cerrado de abdomen con estallido de hígado (‘quedó como papilla’, graficó) y de bazo'. Destacó que la lesión principal fue 'la lesión craneal, se desnucó'. Remarcó que el tipo de golpe que sufrió no lo salvaba el casco tampoco. 'Es un chicotazo de la nuca, el casco no salva, no le evita la causa de muerte'. Y puso como analogía la fuerza de un impacto de 100 kilómetros por hora: 'Es como una caída a 40 metros de altura, de un edificio de diez pisos de altura'. Las pericias del director de la Policía Científica, Juan Carlos Vázquez, indicaron el lunes que, 'a 99,05 kilómetros por hora', Fernando Vázquez fue chocado por detrás, 'sin rastros de frenos ni maniobras' por esquivarlo.",9578,vimos claramente al chico en la motocicleta parado en el semáforo le gritamos lutz con mi amiga la moto la moto frená frená una de las jóvenes que acompañaba julio werner lutz en el ford fiesta que colisionó por detrás fernando fabián vázquez y causó su muerte durante la noche del sábado de agosto de sobre la avenida alicia moreau de justo declaró ayer durante la segunda jornada del juicio oral y público ante el tribunal penal de esta capital florencia wille bille tiene años y hoy es policía de profesión siete años después del siniestro vial de la ex ruta frente al club centro de cazadores se sentó declarar como testigo clave del impacto que le quitó la vida al joven motociclista y empleado que las del día mencionado se dirigía iniciar su turno en una estación de servicios en el cruce de las avenidas san martín y chacabuco señaló que acompañó su amiga sabina yanette chávez al encuentro de automóviles de exposición que se celebraba esa tarde y noche en el autódromo de posadas pasaron buscar por mi casa sabina y lutz en su automóvil ante los juece viviana gladis cukla gustavo arnaldo bernie y miguel mattos la suboficial de la policía de misiones coincidió en sus relato volcado al expediente en la etapa de instrucción de la causa en manos del juez marcelo cardozo y la fiscal amalia spinnato en el autódromo estuvimos menos de dos horas porque yo tenía que volver cuidar mi hermanito y lutz estaba apurado porque tenía que cerrar su negocio en el centro también recordó que durante ese lapso de tiempo lutz compró cervezas tomó y también lo vi fumando un porro ya estaba pasado cuando salimos amplió que al salir del autódromo aceleró el ford fiesta y sintió miedo porque lutz comenzó pasar semáforos en rojo cuando llegamos la avenida miré el velocímetro y vi que iba kilómetro por hora la música estaba fuerte pero yo estaba sentada en el asiento de atrás pero al medio y nos escuchábamos mucho más cuando comenzamo pedirle que bajara la velocidad al meno tre vece se lo pedimos vimos el semáforo en rojo íbamos en el carril izquierdo y estaba parado el muchacho con la moto en el carril derecho había varios auto y como frenaba comencé gritarle el chico el chico pero frenó frenó hasta este punto wille bille contuvo las lágrimas hizo silencio agachó la cabeza vario segundo y la levantó de repente para continuar su testimonio él frenó el frenó lo repitió enfática fue mi amiga la que detuvo el auto ella accionó la palanca del freno de mano porque él iba frenar sobre los instante posteriore la joven remarcó los movimientos de lutz únicamente se preocupó por cómo quedó su auto ni por el muchacho ni por nosotra se preocupó lastimé el hombro una pierna y entró vidrio en el ojo mientras wille bille y su amiga estaban shockeadas por el impacto fueron asistida por dos jóvene que llegaron al lugar en un peugeot quiene las conocían y también participaron en la exposición de automóviles del autódromo denis vittorio vuotto declaró ayer sobre el fatídico episodio sostuvo cuando salimos del autódromo este señor lutz nos pasó alta velocidad era una velocidad normal pero tampoco era extremadamente rápido diez o quince minuto después llegamos al lugar del choque moreau de justo y las américas y vimo las chicas lastimadas y las quisimos llevar al hospital las subimos al auto y en el cruce de la avenida san martín y santa cruz nos cruzamos con la mamá de una de ellas chávez y se pasaron de auto y se fueron tribunal viviana gladis cukla vocal gustavo arnaldo bernie presidente y miguel mattos vocal subrogante causa de muerte la audiencia de debate de ayer se abrió con las conclusiones de la autopsia fernando vázquez silvio orlando mauricio bojanovich integrante del cuerpo médico forense del superior tribunal de justicia explicó las lesiones detectada en el joven de año hemorragia en el cerebro por fractura en la médula espinal traumatismo en el pecho con hemotórax estallido de sangre en los pulmones traumatismo cerrado de abdomen con estallido de hígado quedó como papilla graficó y de bazo destacó que la lesión principal fue la lesión craneal se desnucó remarcó que el tipo de golpe que sufrió lo salvaba el casco tampoco es un chicotazo de la nuca el casco salva le evita la causa de muerte y puso como analogía la fuerza de un impacto de kilómetro por hora es como una caída metro de altura de un edificio de diez pisos de altura las pericia del director de la policía científica juan carlos vázquez indicaron el lunes que kilómetro por hora fernando vázquez fue chocado por detrás sin rastro de frenos ni maniobra por esquivarlo

423370503,"The City of Tshwane has refuted claims that potable water in Mabopane is allegedly of low quality. This follows a voice note doing the rounds that claims the water is not clean and is causing sicknesses like cholera. In one of the audio clips, a woman is heard sharing her alleged experience. 'I almost died. The week the water was out, when it came back and used the water I got a running stomach for five days. I was vomiting, had a headache, I was sweating and I was dehydrated, I cannot say what saved me. I don’t drink water any more, I buy it, unless I am cooking,' said the woman. The woman further alleged the water was not always clean, as one could sometimes spot particles and the water was black or brownish. 'We no longer drink tap water. It is causing sickness to a lot of people. Since I started drinking purified water I no longer get sick,' she said. Another voice clip claims that people had been hospitalised due to the water. City spokesperson Selby Bokaba said the information in the clip about the quality of water was patently false. 'The water supplied in Mabopane is from Rand Water’s Palmiet system. The system also serves many areas upstream such as Laudium, Atteridgeville, Thatchfield and many other areas in Centurion. The water is clear and good for human consumption,' he said. This year over 40 people died in after a cholera outbreak. In June, the country recorded 1,045 suspected cases of cholera across five provinces, 197 of which were laboratory-confirmed. Gauteng accounted for most of the cases at 89% with 176 reported from three districts. So far the source of the waterborne disease has not been determined.

423382686,"Byeong Hun An has been suspended for violating the PGA Tour's antidoping policy because of a banned substance found in cough medicine sold over the counter in South Korea. Follow us: PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.: Byeong Hun An has been suspended for violating the PGA Tour’s anti-doping policy because of a banned substance found in cough medicine sold over the counter in South Korea. The PGA Tour announced the three-month suspension Wednesday and said the 32-year-old An cooperated during the process and accepted his suspension. He is believed to be the eighth player suspended since the PGA Tour began drug testing in 2008, and the first since Matt Every in 2019. An finished 44th in the FedEx Cup this year, so he is qualified for all of the $20 million signature events in 2024. The suspension is retroactive to Aug. 31, meaning he will be eligible to return on Dec. 1. He has not played since the BMW Championship in August. The FedEx Cup fall swing is primarily for players trying to secure their PGA Tour cards for next season. An, who at 17 became the youngest U.S. Amateur champion in 2009 at Southern Hills, has yet to win on the PGA Tour. He won the European tour’s flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship, in 2015. He played in the Presidents Cup in 2019 in Australia.

An’s suspension officially began on Aug. 31, which means he will be eligible to return to competition on Dec. 1. According to a statement issued by the Tour, he has cooperated fully with the Tour throughout the process and accepted his suspension. As per Tour policy, the Tour said they would have no further comment on the suspension at this time. An is a former winner of the U.S. Amateur and has won on the DP World Tour but is still seeking his first PGA Tour title. An, who has represented the International Team in the Presidents Cups, lost his card after the 2020-2021 season but won on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2022 and made it to the BMW Championship, the second of three FedEx Cup events this season. At No. 44 in the FedEx Cup standings, he already is exempt into all of the signature events in 2024.

423356130,"David Obege left his home at Enzaro in South Maragoli on August 20, 2021 to attend a friend's funeral. On the way to the service, he passed through his cousin Samuel Omindo's homestead and paused his journey for a chat. The greetings, however, led to a quarrel of sorts as the two had a strained relationship, and soon a fight broke out between them. Things escalated and Omindo, 63, ended up hitting his cousin on the head. After the assault, the victim, who sustained deep cut wounds on his head, was left bleeding by the roadside. Children passing by found Obege and had him rushed to a dispensary where he died while undergoing treatment. Area assistant chief informed the police about the incident who in turn took the deceased’s body to Vihiga County Referral Hospital Mortuary for autopsy. Postmortem showed that Obege's death was caused by intracranial haemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) due to deep cut wounds. Three days later on August 24, 2021, Omindo was arrested and after investigations, he was charged with murder at the Vihiga High Court. On July 31, 2023, he entered a Plea Agreement and was convicted with manslaughter. Omindo urged the court to sentence him to five years imprisonment, while the state recommended a seven-year sentence. In his mitigation, the convict said he was remorseful. He asked for mercy on the grounds that he was a 63-year-old single father of four, who depended on him. Omindo urged the court to consider the two years he spent in police custody since his arrest on August 20, 2021. While objecting to a non-custodial sentence, the probation office told the court that Obege's wife was still bitter with her husband's killer and was yet to forgive Omindo. Further, the pre-sentencing report submitted by the office showed that the feelings of the community and local administration towards Omindo were still hostile. According to them, the man was stubborn, noisy, disagreeable, never at peace with neighbours and a bhang smoker. Omindo is said to have had a long list of unreported felonies and the community was still hostile and not accommodative of his release on a non-custodial sentence. 'The Probation Office did not therefore find him suitable to consider him for a non-custodial sentence,' the court document reads. J udge Jacqueline Kamau considered the submissions and noted that the principle of sentencing is fairness, justice, proportionality and commitment to public safety. The main objectives of sentencing are retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, rehabilitation and reparation She pointed out that there was no evidence to suggest that the deceased provoked his cousin warranting him to hit him with a panga. Considering this, she concluded that it was necessary that any punishment that was meted to Omindo deters him from committing a similar action in the future. 'It was also important that the sentence communicate to the community, condemnation of his criminal act. The sentence would indirectly send a strong signal to deter would-be offenders from committing such an offence,' the judge added. While delivering her judgment on October 5, Judge Kamau imposed a 12- year sentence on the convict. 'Having considered the facts of this case and the Accused person’s mitigation, this court has come to the firm conclusion that a sentence of 12 years would be suitable and adequate herein,' the judge said. The court took into account the time Omindo spent in custody while awaiting the verdict from September 23, 2021 to October 4, 2023. 'Accordingly, it is hereby directed that the accused person be and is hereby sentenced to 12 years imprisonment to run from today (October 5),' the court ordered.",9578,david obege leave home enzaro south maragoli august attend friend funeral way service pass cousin samuel omindo homestead pause journey chat greeting lead quarrel sort strained relationship soon fight break thing escalate omindo end hit cousin head assault victim sustain deep cut wound head leave bleed roadside child pass find obege rush dispensary die undergo treatment area assistant chief inform police incident turn take deceased body vihiga county referral hospital mortuary autopsy postmortem show obege death cause intracranial haemorrhage bleed brain deep cut wound day later august omindo arrest investigation charge murder vihiga high court july enter plea agreement convict manslaughter omindo urge court sentence year imprisonment state recommend seven year sentence mitigation convict say remorseful ask mercy ground year old single father depend omindo urge court consider year spend police custody arrest august object non custodial sentence probation office tell court obege wife bitter husband killer forgive omindo pre sentencing report submit office show feeling community local administration omindo hostile accord man stubborn noisy disagreeable peace neighbour bhang smoker omindo say long list unreported felony community hostile accommodative release non custodial sentence probation office find suitable consider non custodial sentence court document read j udge jacqueline kamau consider submission note principle sentencing fairness justice proportionality commitment public safety main objective sentencing retribution incapacitation deterrence rehabilitation reparation point evidence suggest decease provoke cousin warrant hit panga consider conclude necessary punishment mete omindo deter commit similar action future important sentence communicate community condemnation criminal act sentence indirectly send strong signal deter offender commit offence judge add deliver judgment october judge kamau impose year sentence convict having consider fact case accuse person mitigation court come firm conclusion sentence year suitable adequate judge say court take account time omindo spend custody await verdict september october accordingly direct accuse person sentence year imprisonment run today october court order
423355506,"HONOLULU -- Sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) adults are at an increased risk for severe asthma, according to an analysis of a nationally representative study. Compared with straight people, asthma attacks that required the use of steroids were more likely among SGM patients (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.15), reported Tugba Kaplan, MD, of Luminis Health-Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Maryland, during the CHEST annual meeting hosted by the American College of Chest Physicians. SGM patients were also more likely to have asthma attacks that kept them for normal daily activities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10-1.61), and more likely to experience shortness of breath during any given week (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.32-2.51). Previous studies have indicated that SGM patients experience many healthcare disparities, which may be related to insurance gaps, the need for culturally competent healthcare providers who are trained in caring for SGM patients, and concerns about discrimination from healthcare providers, which could lead to less access to more regular healthcare, Kaplan said. She noted that there is little research on respiratory health in particular among SGM patients. 'To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing asthma severity among SGM people in a nationally representative longitudinal cohort study.' Kaplan said that she hopes that this research, and acknowledging the disparities for SGM people, will lead to more diverse research on health impacts unique to SGM patients, as well as better preparation for providers to meet that challenge. 'For fair health outcomes, I think it is so important to implement specific health promotion efforts tailored to different cultures, offer cultural sensitivity training to healthcare professionals, and conduct research with a focus on targeted interventions,' she added. For this analysis, data on adults were taken from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) waves 3, 4, and 5, which spanned 2015 to 2019. Kaplan and team included a total of 14,694 participants; 9.4% identified as SGM, and 90.6% identified as straight. Six questions assessing asthma severity were used. The response options were dichotomized as 'intermittent=0' and 'persistent=1' based on the asthma severity index. Questions covered asthma attacks requiring steroids, emergency or urgent care visits, asthma preventing daily activities or productivity, rescue inhaler use, shortness of breath, and asthma symptoms waking participants at night. They also asked about tobacco use, including use of both electronic cigarettes and traditional combustible tobacco cigarettes, combustible use of tobacco cigarettes alone, lifetime use of electronic cigarettes, switching to electronic cigarettes after using traditional cigarettes, and never having used any form of tobacco products. Among participants who responded that they had lifetime exclusive electronic cigarette use, SGM participants were 7.81 times more likely to have asthma symptoms that woke them up at night compared with straight participants. For participants who never used any tobacco products, no significant differences were seen between the SGM and straight patients. As for future research, Kaplan noted during a Q&A portion of the presentation that while marijuana use and its effects were not included in this study, it is a potential target for future research.",9578,honolulu sexual gender minoritize sgm adult increase risk severe asthma accord analysis nationally representative study compare straight people asthma attack require use steroid likely sgm patient ci report tugba kaplan md luminis health anne arundel medical center annapolis maryland chest annual meeting host american college chest physicians sgm patient likely asthma attack keep normal daily activity ci likely experience shortness breath give week ci previous study indicate sgm patient experience healthcare disparity relate insurance gap need culturally competent healthcare provider train care sgm patient concern discrimination healthcare provider lead access regular healthcare kaplan say note little research respiratory health particular sgm patient good knowledge study assess asthma severity sgm people nationally representative longitudinal cohort study kaplan say hope research acknowledge disparity sgm people lead diverse research health impact unique sgm patient well preparation provider meet challenge fair health outcome think important implement specific health promotion effort tailor different culture offer cultural sensitivity training healthcare professional conduct research focus target intervention add analysis datum adult take population assessment tobacco health path wave span kaplan team include total participant identify sgm identify straight question assess asthma severity response option dichotomize base asthma severity index question cover asthma attack require steroid emergency urgent care visit asthma prevent daily activity productivity rescue inhaler use shortness breath asthma symptom wake participant night ask tobacco use include use electronic cigarette traditional combustible tobacco cigarette combustible use tobacco cigarette lifetime use electronic cigarette switch electronic cigarette traditional cigarette having form tobacco product participant respond lifetime exclusive electronic cigarette use sgm participant time likely asthma symptom wake night compare straight participant participant tobacco product significant difference see sgm straight patient future research kaplan note portion presentation marijuana use effect include study potential target future research

423352807,"Ian is professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Oxford and honorary consultant physician at the Oxford University Hospitals. Welcome everybody to InDiscussion . Ian, it's great to have you today. What I know about you is a little different from what everyone else knows about you. Most people recognize you as a respiratory physician who's been leading many of the clinical trials in severe asthma for the past few decades. What I know about you is that you are an outstanding golfer. In fact, you are probably the best golfer I've ever played with. The last time we played, just a couple of weeks ago, you actually got an eagle on the 18th hole, which was incredible. Tell us something that other listeners may not know about you, other than your respiratory and golfing prowess. Ian D. Pavord, DM: I'm a Welshman. Not many people know that. But it's very important in the United Kingdom. And I'm the first professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Oxford, which is a 1000-year-old institute. Now you have two things. But I want to talk about the golf a bit more. I can talk you through the eagle in fine detail if you'd like. Wechsler: We're going to have to have a whole other podcast about your golfing prowess. Maybe at that time you can also try to help me with my golf swing. Tell us, what was it about respiratory medicine and asthma that first drew you into this specialty? Pavord: I had asthma as a child, and my mother had it, and her mother died of asthma. At the time, you shrug those things off and get on with it, but I remember whenever I went to friends' houses or was in contact with pets, I couldn't breathe. That would last for a few days, and I just got used to it. This was the way my life was until I started an inhaled steroid as a 10 year old. I was probably one of the first people to be put on it. Suddenly, my life was normal, and it was a revelation. I was very interested in asthma from that point. The second factor was that I really liked pulmonologists. I thought they were the nicest doctors I came across when I was training. What about you, Mike? Wechsler: I initially was fascinated by critical care medicine. I found that it touched on a lot of different specialties and there were many challenges. In the United States, when you do critical care medicine, one option is to do it in combination with respiratory medicine because of the importance of the lungs and use of ventilators in those kinds of patients. Once I decided to go into respiratory medicine, I had a tremendous group of mentors, including Jeff Drazen, Elliot Israel, and Scott Weiss. They are the ones who really inspired me to move into asthma research where there was a significant unmet need. I knew of this need from kids I grew up with as well, who had issues similar to you — carrying around an and having shortness of breath. We've really come a long way since we were both kids. The practice of asthma management has changed so much over the past several decades. When we were younger, there weren't a lot of options. You had bronchodilators and then inhaled corticosteroids, and maybe theophylline was around, as well. Tell us a little bit about how asthma therapy has evolved in the past 30-40 years. Pavord: I've been treating asthma patients for nearly that long and particularly those with severe asthma. Our job was tough to do because although we could help some of our patients with oral corticosteroids, for example, we had this really uneasy feeling that we were doing harm as well as good. We could get into a situation where we wondered whether the treatment was worse than the condition, and patients developed more and more problems. Some of the problems were linked to treatment, but others were linked to incompletely controlled asthma. There is a massive unmet need for better treatments, particularly in these patients with more severe asthma. That's where the big advances have been. We're both very lucky to have been in the middle of this. It's been a very, very exciting past 10 years. Wechsler: In the past 25 years, we've evolved from just having inhaled steroids and beta-agonists to the development of leukotriene modifiers, which have had a modest impact in terms of improving lung function by reducing inflammation. And then in 2003, just 20 years ago now, there was development of the first monoclonal antibody targeting immunoglobulin E with omalizumab , and that was a big paradigm shift. How have things changed since that time for you, in the past 20 years, as we've had other biologic therapies evolve? Pavord: The key thing is the recognition that there are phenotypes of asthma and particularly the identification of type 2 airway inflammation as a key driver of many of the clinical problems our patients with severe and less severe asthma have. This has become an identifiable process with the discovery of simple, clinically accessible biomarkers , and these biomarkers are incredibly predictive. Wechsler: It's been a huge paradigm shift. Even 10 years ago, people were not measuring eosinophils or nitric oxide routinely, and now it's part of routine practice because we really want to know what type of asthma our patients have. Asthma is a very heterogeneous disease, and one of the biggest advances has been our appreciation of the heterogeneity and complexity of asthma and all the different cells involved. It isn't just eosinophils, it isn't just neutrophils, and it isn't just mast cells. The epithelium is involved, and then on top of that, we have identified novel cytokines — not just interleukin (IL)-4, 5, and 13 — but the , IL-33, and others. That's been huge for us and led to several novel therapies that have changed the way we see and manage these patients. Pavord: Absolutely, and these drugs are highly targeted. They have an enviable safety record, and we can largely predict who's going to respond using simple biomarker measurements in clinics. When you can identify a process that is linked to a good treatment response, you're in a really good position. These biologic drugs have done incredibly well. They've changed the landscape. Severe asthma is a very different beast than what it was 10 years ago. And they've got us thinking about where we are going with these drugs. We have many patients who have high biomarkers but have not yet progressed to severe asthma. Should we be treating these patients in order to prevent downstream problems? These are really exciting concepts. There are new cytokine targets. You've been very involved in some of the new upstream targets such as anti-TSLP and anti–IL-33. Where do you think these fit? We've got, in a way, an embarrassment of riches now. Wechsler: My feeling is that we do and we don't. In the past 8 years here in the US, in the UK, and globally, there's been approval of three different anti–IL-5 therapies — , and benralizumab . We've had approval of anti–IL-4/IL-13 therapy with dupilumab , and we've had approval of anti TSLP therapy with tezepelumab. What these therapies have been shown to do is reduce exacerbation, reduce steroid dosing, improve symptoms, improved quality of life, and improve lung function. I'm concerned about what they haven't done, which is that they haven't eliminated asthma exacerbations. They haven't eliminated the use of corticosteroids in majority of patients. They haven't resulted in complete improvement or reversal of lung function in many of our patients. Lately, we've been talking about remission as an outcome, but only somewhere between 15% and 40% of patients can achieve remission with these therapies. What are your perspectives on the unmet needs? You can look at the glass half full or half empty. We're so fortunate from a glass half-full perspective. On the other hand, there are still patients out there who need other therapies. What's your perspective on this? Pavord: That's an excellent summary of where we are. Why is there is a lot of asthma left in many patients despite treatment with a biologic? What we don't know is whether that asthma reflects damage that was done as a result of unchecked type 2 airway inflammation and other processes. If we got in earlier with these drugs, might we prevent that damage and achieve remission? Are there other targets? Are there other biological processes that we can tease out, modify with specific drugs, and show clinical benefit? For example, the macrolide effect seems to occur independent of type 2 airway inflammation. What's that about? Can we understand why macrolides have a big impact? Can we improve treatments and perhaps nonantimicrobial macrolides? Sometimes in medicine, knowing very clearly what you can't do is just as important as knowing very clearly what you can do. We are getting closer to that, but my guess — and I want your view on this — is that quite a lot of people I see don't achieve a very vaulted clinical state–like remission. The primary reason they don't achieve this is that they are irreparably damaged by their disease, and we've potentially missed an opportunity to achieve remission by getting in a bit earlier. Certainly in the UK, that's my feeling. It may be different with you. Wechsler: My feeling is that there's probably multiple reasons why patients don't respond to the currently available biologics who we would think might otherwise respond. I don't think we do a good enough job of addressing comorbidities, whether it's severe reflux disease, aspiration, sinusitis postnasal drip, or sleep apnea. That's one perspective and one component of all this. The other component is that asthma is very dynamic and heterogeneous. While a patient might appear to be eosinophilic, for instance, at one time point, they might have some other environmental stimulus, whether it's an irritant or an allergen, which might produce a different mechanism of disease. We're good at blocking a dominant pathway, but sometimes we need to block multiple pathways. I liked what you said about maybe treating earlier in the disease. What do you see as some of the barriers to doing that, though? Pavord: The major barrier is that people are not measuring these key biomarkers. We tend to focus on measuring damage rather than disease activity, and we need to move that around. The patients we really need to see are people with very active high-risk disease but before the consequences have played out and they have developed all the comorbidities you just outlined. Measuring a patient's biomarkers and finding eosinophilia is significant, and a patient with obstructive airways disease is always a significant finding. It's a very useful finding. It allows you to make predictions. Exhaled nitric oxide is a simple test to do. It takes 5-10 seconds, and you get an immediate result. Why aren't we doing that? It doesn't require a specialist technician to do this measurement. It can be done in a pharmacy or a primary care center. That's probably where we need to go. It takes a bit of time to get this mindset out there, and guidelines probably need to be a little more ambitious, in my view. But it's an obvious direction for us to go, and it's an exciting opportunity because in airways disease, we haven't been 'predictors and preventers.' We've been anything but 'predictors and preventers.' We wait until our patients' lungs are really badly damaged and they've got a lot of other clinical problems, and then we take them seriously. It would be lovely to turn that around before we hang up our stethoscopes and disappear into a retirement full of golf and eagles and other things. Wechsler: I wholeheartedly agree with you about the underutilization of biomarkers. You and I have had discussions where we've compared not evaluating all the biomarkers to not doing a complete cardiac catheterization. If you don't look at the right coronary, you're going to miss out on potential disease there. It's the same thing by not measuring nitric oxide. You might be missing something. The other barrier that I see is cost. These biologic therapies, while very effective, are quite costly. We're going to have to generate really sufficient data to support their use in patients with disease of lesser severity and earlier on in the disease in order to justify the cost of these therapies in aggregate. I know there are strict regulations in the UK by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) , and I think payers in the US will also restrict with lesser severity. There's one concept of treating earlier in disease, and the other concept might be treating earlier in life. Maybe we need to do studies in that area. There's one study with omalizumab now that's being done. Omalizumab is being given to kids who are 2-3 years old who are at risk for asthma. We need to generate some of these data points, as well. Pavord: That would be great. Cost is a big issue in the UK. Of course, the rheumatologists had this issue 20 years ago with their biologics, but costs have come down very substantially. I think people have been surprised how successful biologics for type 2 asthma have been when you have a predictive biomarker. It incentivized doctors to go looking for these people, and I think that has been happening. When the drugs are selling well, hopefully costs will go down. And then there are nonbiologic antieosinophil strategies out there that may work and may be less expensive. I'm not as gloomy as you may be about prospects there. I think we'll see costs coming down. Wechsler: I would love to see that, but we know how society works, and sometimes you have to follow the money trail. You touched on the use of macrolides. I view them as particularly useful where there's a gap, which is in the patients who don't have non–type 2 asthma . Can we talk a little bit about that unmet needs of patients with non-type 2 asthma? What's your current strategy for these patients? And where do you see the non–type 2 asthma field going in the future? Pavord: The clinical scenario, I think, is either a highly symptomatic patient who has low biomarkers or a patient who's continuing to have exacerbations despite low biomarkers, and sometimes both. If it's a symptom issue, my first thought is, are there comorbidities here? Obesity is the number one comorbidity, and it is much more important, interestingly, in women than men. This is probably because women's lungs for a given height tend to be a bit smaller. Because of this, the restrictive effects of obesity are noticed more. Obesity is a massive cause of symptom-high, type 2–low asthma. There's a real danger in these patients of unnecessary and completely useless escalation of steroid therapy, which can also cause problems. If the problem is an exacerbation problem, my first thought is airway infection.",9578,ian professor respiratory medicine university oxford honorary consultant physician oxford university hospitals

423385612,"Jake Carrigan of Hutchinson, Minnesota, recently was at work when his brother sent him an alarming text. Someone posted a picture of a lost dog on Facebook that closely resembled his dog Dozer and that he was potentially was hit by a car. Carrigan drove to the location of where the person had seen the dog, but he didn’t appear to be there. Carrigan had to return to work, so he asked his neighbor, Jay, to open Carrigan's garage door in case Dozer came back. The neighbor went to search for the dog as well and discovered he was in a patch of tall grass by trees. Because Dozer wouldn't let Jay get close to him, Jay sent Carrigan the exact location. 'When I found him, he couldn't walk,' Carrigan explained, in a Pet Poison Helpline release. 1 'He bit at my hand when I went to pick him up, which he would never normally do. I knew there was something wrong, so I immediately took him to our veterinarian.' According to Renee Schmid, DVM, DABVT, DABT, a senior veterinary toxicologist at Pet Poison Helpline, when Dozer arrived at Lifelong Veterinary Clinic he was incapable of moving his rear limbs, was dull, and hypersensitive. 'Abdominal x-rays revealed that the stomach was full, so the medical team induced emesis and found about a pound and a half of what they determined was chocolate brownies containing marijuana,' she explained. Schmid added that marijuana exposure in pets has become more prevalent as states legalize recreational and medicinal marijuana. Over a 6 year period, the Pet Poison Helpline reported a 448% increase in marijuana poisoning in companion animals. 2 Clinical signs of marijuana exposure include stumbling and crossing over feet, dull and lethargic, dilated pupils, urinary incontinence, vomiting, tremors and shaking, and agitation. 3. 'The veterinarian told me that after they emptied his stomach, the entire clinic smelled like a marijuana dispensary,' shared Carrigan. 'The whole situation was weird. I don't know if he snuck into someone's house, or if someone fed him the brownies. Maybe they were cooling outside, and he helped himself. I asked my neighbor who I suspect might indulge in such brownies, and he said they didn't come from his house.' Chocolate poisoning from the brownies was also a concern. Schmid said in the release 1 that the severity of chocolate poisoning is dependent on the type and amount of chocolate ingested and the pet’s size. 'Also, be aware that some chocolate products may contain other toxins such as macadamia nuts, raisins, coffee or expresso beans or xylitol,' she noted. 'Ingestion in toxic amounts can result in vomiting, diarrhea, hyperactivity, elevated heart rate, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors and seizures. Death is possible, but rare if the pet receives prompt and appropriate treatment. Interestingly, dogs make up 95% of our chocolate calls.' References Missing dog found high on pot brownies.

423359263,"Introduction Lambda -cyhalothrin (Type II pyrethroid insecticide) has a wide range of insecticidal (Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera) and acaricidal activities (Leaf mites, rust mites and gall mites) (Kroeger et al., 2003; Martínez et al., 2018). It is used for pest control in vegetables, cereals and cotton, among others, and the control of external parasites (ticks, fleas, lice, mites and fleas) in livestock, poultry and dogs (Anadón et al., 2009; Fetoui et al., 2015; Chatterjee et al., 2021a). Lambda -cyhalothrin can also be used in public health applications or structural pest management to control insects that may act as disease vectors. Studies have shown that Type II pyrethroids are easily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally, mainly due to α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and halogen groups (Anadón et al., 1996, 2006). At acute toxic doses, Type I pyrethroids cause paralysis, hyperexcitation and tremor, whereas Type II pyrethroids cause hypersensitivity, choreoathetosis and salivation (Anadón et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2021). Due to its high efficiency, easy biodegradation and low toxicity (Kale et al., 1999), this active substance appears to be a more commonly used insecticide than organochlorines and organophosphates (Pauluhn, 1999). The United States of America, China and India are the main consumers and producers of lambda -cyhalothrin, whereas Thailand, Australia, Japan, Germany, Russia and other countries will become the main consumers of lambda -cyhalothrin due to the increase in cultivated land area. The demand for lambda -cyhalothrin may result in a growth rate of more than 14% during the forecast period. The market is likely to exceed $3.8 billion by 2027, up from $1.25 billion in 2020. However, the extensive use of lambda -cyhalothrin has resulted in serious environmental pollution (Lubick, 2008; Arthidoro de Castro et al., 2020; Kenko et al., 2023), and it can be found in many different environmental regions (van der Sluijs et al., 2015). For example, in Costa Rica, 0.98 μg/L lambda -cyhalothrin has been found in sediments from agroecosystems (Carazo-Rojas et al., 2018); in surface water, the concentrations of lambda -cyhalothrin ranged from 0.35 to 0.80 μg/L (Anderson et al., 2013; Tsaboula et al., 2016). Lambda -cyhalothrin can enter the body by several means: inhalation, ingestion and contact. This considerably increases the risk of human exposure to lambda -cyhalothrin. Lambda -cyhalothrin is closely associated with toxicity issues in various organs of non-target organisms (terrestrial and aquatic animals), with oxidative stress being the main cause. For example, in male Sprague-Dawley rat liver, 6.12 mg/kg bw lambda -cyhalothrin increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities; at the same time, it can cause oxidative damage and interfere with the antioxidant status, which is manifested by the increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl (PCO) contents and the decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities (Lu et al., 2019; El-Saad and Abdel-Wahab, 2020). Lambda -cyhalothrin treatment can reduce CAT and SOD levels and increase malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in male Wistar rats, and the comet test results showed that it can also significantly induce thyroid DNA damage (Al-Amoudi, 2018). In addition, Lambda -cyhalothrin is highly toxic to a variety of fish, and the mean lethal concentrations for sheepshead minnow ( Cypronodum variegatus ) and rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) range from 0.008 to 0.24 μg/L (He et al., 2008). In the streaked prochilod ( Prochilodus lineatus lambda -cyhalothrin (0.005–0.5 μg/L) can induce genetic and oxidative damage, as well as neural alterations (Vieira and dos Reis Martinez, 2018). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics studies have shown that lambda -cyhalothrin significantly reduced the phosphocholine level in the brain of goldfish ( Carassius auratus ), suggesting that membrane damage caused by hypoxia is associated with the excessive release of ROS and LPO as well as with protein degradation caused by lambda -cyhalothrin (Li et al., 2014). In addition, lambda -cyhalothrin reduced the N-acetylaspartic acid levels in the brain of goldfish ( Carassius auratus ), which is associated with mitochondrial damage mediated by lambda -cyhalothrin through oxidative stress (Li et al., 2014). Further results indicate that lambda -cyhalothrin is associated with hepatotoxicity in non-target animals (El-Saad and Abdel-Wahab, 2020), nephrotoxicity (Cavuşoğlu et al., 2011), neurotoxicity (Wolansky and Harrill, 2008; Fetoui and Gdoura, 2012; Lopez-Torres et al., 2022; Kumari et al., 2023) and reproductive toxicity (Ben Abdallah et al., 2013); oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage seem to be the main cause of these toxicities. Therefore, to reduce the harm caused by the consumption of agricultural food residues, inhalation or skin contact with lambda -cyhalothrin, attention must be paid to the toxicity of lambda -cyhalothrin. In recent years, the toxicity of lambda -cyhalothrin to non-target organisms has attracted more and more attention. For example, lambda -cyhalothrin showed pancreatic toxicity (Wang et al., 2014; Sakr and Rashad, 2023), hepatotoxicity and oxidative damage in rats and mice (El-Saad and Abdel-Wahab, 2020; Yang et al., 2023); embryonic toxicity (Yang et al., 2020) and oxidative damage in fish (Zhang et al., 2017; Clasen et al., 2018; Fernandes et al., 2020); acute toxicity in pigeons (Noreen et al., 2023) and neurotoxicity in humans (Naveen et al., 2023). However, the mechanism of its toxicity has not been fully explained, so it is necessary to review the mechanism and research progress of its toxicity. This review article summarizes the relationship between lambda -cyhalothrin-induced toxicity and oxidative stress and for the first time explains the mechanism of lambda -cyhalothrin toxicity from the perspective of oxidative stress. In addition, is summarizes the changes in antioxidant status induced by lambda -cyhalothrin; the lambda -cyhalothrin-mediated oxidation signalling pathway, the main metabolites and metabolic pathways of lambda -cyhalothrin, the main metabolic enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway and the regulatory roles of active substances in the toxicity of lambda -cyhalothrin. There is evidence that oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage are inextricably linked to lambda -cyhalothrin-induced toxicity, and the application of antioxidants can significantly alleviate the toxic effects of lambda -cyhalothrin. Section snippets Approach to the systematic review. The important role of position of oxidative stress in lambda -cyhalothrin toxicity was reviewed. The systematic search strategies used in this review refer to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (Polanin et al., 2019; Schichtel et al., 2020). The methods of literature retrieval and the criteria of literature selection in this present systematic review (based on the PRISMA flow chart) are shown in Fig. 1. The literature was retrieved from three databases Oxidative damage mediated by lambda -cyhalothrin. Oxidative stress refers to the disruption of the balance between the production and scavenging of free radicals, resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen (Lu et al., 2019; Chiarello et al., 2020; Hameister et al., 2020). Lambda -cyhalothrin therefore causes oxidative stress damage through ROS production. In one study, lambda -cyhalothrin (271 and 542 ng/L) increased the ROS levels in the rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) brain, thereby increasing the Lambda -cyhalothrin-mediated significant changes in the antioxidant status. The increase of ROS production induced by lambda -cyhalothrin can disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis and cause oxidative damage. Previous studies have shown that lambda -cyhalothrin is closely associated with changes in the antioxidant status in aquatic ( Oreochromis niloticus and Brycon amazonicus ) and terrestrial animals (male Swiss mice and male Wistar rats). The changes in the antioxidant status were related to SOD, CAT, GST, GPx, glutathione reductase (GR), GSH and other antioxidant Signalling pathway of oxidative stress induced by lambda -cyhalothrin. Lambda -cyhalothrin-mediated oxidative stress and induced significant changes in the antioxidant status demonstrate the important role of oxidative damage in lambda -cyhalothrin toxicity. Comparatively, there are few findings on the mechanism and signalling pathway of oxidative toxicity induced by lambda -cyhalothrin. However, some studies emphasize the role of inflammatory cytokines, NF-κB, the caspase/Bcl-2/Bax pathway, the Ca 2+ signalling pathway, the Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway, the Regulatory effect of exogenous substances on lambda -cyhalothrin-induced oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occupies an important position in lambda -cyhalothrin hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity (Martínez et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2022; Lopez-Torres et al., 2022) and reproductive system toxicity (Zhang et al., 2021). Therefore, the inhibition of oxidative stress is an important strategy to reduce the toxicity induced by lambda -cyhalothrin. To better prevent lambda -cyhalothrin toxicity to non-target animals, it is necessary to review the exogenous substances (chemicals Metabolism of lambda -cyhalothrin. Metabolism occupies a key position in the regulation of chemical toxicity. For example, harmless chemical substances can be transformed into highly toxic metabolites, and toxic substances can be biologically converted into less harmful or more harmful metabolites (Andersen, 1981; Kaneko, 2011). Therefore, to understand the toxic mechanism of lambda -cyhalothrin, this review focused on the main metabolites of lambda -cyhalothrin as well as metabolic enzymes involved in metabolic reactions and Conclusions. Lambda -cyhalothrin is used to control pests and diseases in vegetables, crops and households (Fetoui et al., 2010) as well as in the control of external parasites in animals. However, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, reproductive toxicity and neurotoxicity caused by lambda -cyhalothrin alone or in combination with other insecticides have been widely reported. Therefore, to better protect non-target animals, the toxicity of lambda -cyhalothrin, along with its underlying mechanism, were reviewed in Credit author statement.

423287048,"Prensa MPPS-. El Día Mundial de los Cuidados Paliativos, se conmemora el segundo sábado del mes de octubre, cada año se apoya una modalidad que busca ayudar, apoyar y mejorar, la situación de los pacientes con enfermedades oncológicas y sus familiares, y el entorno de cara a preservar la mejor calidad de vida posible hasta el final de la vida, afrontando una mejor manera, la partida de ese ser querido. Con el avance de las enfermedades oncológicas, los pacientes que padecen de cuidados paliativos, estos son definidos por la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), como un conjunto de medidas capaz de promover la calidad de vida del paciente y sus familiares que presentan esta enfermedad, el cual amenaza la continuidad de la vida a través de la prevención y el alivio del sufrimiento físico, psicosocial o espiritual. Estos cuidados, se dan cuando se diagnostica alguna enfermedad crónica, entonces se inicia con el tratamiento y el seguimiento de los mismos, los pacientes que padecen estos cuidados son aquellos que tienen algunas enfermedades tales como: Cáncer, Enfermedad Cardiaca, Cáncer Pulmonar obstructiva crónica, Insuficiencia Renal, Alzheimer, Parkinson, Esclerosis lateral, entre otros. Esta disciplina, exige un abordaje en el que intervienen de forma sinérgica el paciente, la familia y el entorno de cara a preservar la mejor calidad de vida posible hasta el final de la vida. Enfoque integral. La OMS ha decretado, que los cuidados son un derecho para todas las personas alrededor del mundo, la terapia del cuidado comprende unos amplios conjuntos de tratamientos que van desde el suministro de medicamentos aliviando el dolor físico de cada individuo hasta el tratamiento psicológico tanto para el enfermo como la familia porque se ejecuta un trabajo social y un conjunto de actividades que le permita disfrutar de la mejor manera sus últimos momentos en este mundo. Origen. El origen etimológico de la palabra paliativo, es la palabra latina pallium, que significa manto o cubierta, haciendo alusión al acto de aliviar síntomas o sufrimiento, además la palabra latina Hospitium significaba inicialmente el sentimiento cálido experimentado por huésped y luego el lugar físico donde este sentimiento se experimentaba, durante la Edad Media los hospicios fueron lugares de acogida para peregrinos, los que muchas veces venían gravemente enfermos o moribundos, asimismo, estos lugares no sólo daban refugio y alimento a extranjeros, sino también cuidados a enfermos y moribundos. Para el año 1967, apareció en Londres el primer hospicio que acepto a personas con enfermedades crónicas el cual brindó un apoyo físico y psíquico a los pacientes como a las familias para sobrellevar el duelo, además se les efectuaron estudios para encontrar tratamientos para otorgar el tiempo de vida en el futuro, hoy en día se entiende como un centro de cuidados paliativos, el cual brinda una importante atención al paciente y a los familiares para que acepten la situación. Sin embargo, la palabra hospice puede usarse como sinónimo de hospital, por esta razón, Balfour Mount acuñó el término Cuidados Paliativos en lugar de Hospice para ser utilizado en Canadá como también en Inglaterra optó por nombrar como Medicina Paliativa a la disciplina que en el año 1987 sería aceptada por primera vez en el mundo. Por otra parte, en el siglo XIX, el alivio de síntomas fue la tarea principal del tratamiento médico, ya que las enfermedades evolucionan básicamente siguiendo su historia natural, igualmente la medicina cambió de orientación, concentrando sus esfuerzos en descubrir las causas y curas de las enfermedades. Es importante resaltar, que hay un gran equipo multidisciplinario que comprende por el equipo de médico incluido el especialista, enfermero (a), Nutricionista, Psicólogo, Terapista, Trabajadora Social, Capellán, Psiquiatra, Fisioterapeuta, entre otros, estos deben contar con competencias y experiencias en el manejo del paciente en la atención física y emocional. En este sentido, este equipo cumple un papel fundamental y reconoce que el final de la vida debe ser con dignidad respetando las opiniones de cada paciente con sus limitaciones temores y angustias. De igual forma, estas relaciones humanas son establecidas durante el cuidado y desarrollo de la enfermedad, esta percepción es definida como un acto o efecto de percibir una combinación de sentidos en el reconocimiento de un objeto o situación a partir de la recepción de un estímulo externo que ocurre en los sentidos, sensación, intuición, idea construida sobre el objeto o situación intelectual de cada individuo. Conmemoración. El objetivo, es concienciar a las personas sobre este tipo de tratamientos y ayudar a sobrellevar de mejor manera este tipo de terapias, los profesionales de la salud centran su atención en garantizar al paciente una nueva visión holística en todo lo bueno que sembró y en darle las gracias a la vida por haberles permitido disfrutar de ella así sea un breve momento, además los especialistas tienen otra meta en ayudar a las familias a prepararse para lo inevitable y poder resignarse de la mejor manera la pérdida. Es por ello que este grupo familiar se somete a terapias psicológicas y de trabajo social cerrando cualquier proceso emocional que guarde relación con el paciente. Dr. Tulio González. Por otro lado, el presidente de la Sociedad Venezolana de la Medicina Paliativa, coordinador y médico cirujano, Dr. Tulio González, explicó, que “estos cuidados integrales están dirigidos a los pacientes y la familia y va dirigidos a todos aquellos pacientes de enfermedades crónicas avanzada ya sea oncológica o no oncológica, en el caso de los oncológicos los cuidados paliativos o la medicina integral debe ser dirigida del mismo modo que se le da el diagnostico, la Sociedad Americana recomienda que inicie esta fase cuando el paciente oncológico ya va a una segunda línea, no esperar que este avanzado”. ¿Quiénes proporcionan los cuidados paliativos? “Un equipo de multidisciplinario brinda esta atención integral, donde un médico paliativo dirige el mismo con otros especialistas antes mencionados”, dijo. ¿Quiénes pueden recibir estos cuidados? “Aquellos pacientes con enfermedades crónicas ya que la misma no se cura, solo se controla, pero va hacia la terminalidad por ejemplo un individuo que tenga insuficiencia renal o hepática, trastorno neurológico es susceptible de esta atención integral, ya que está relacionado a varios síntomas como mareos, náuseas, vómitos, tos, hipo, dolor entre otros, estos pacientes también reciben radioterapia quimioterapia y hace que tenga dolor y ardor”. ¿Qué características debe poseer el paciente para recibir terapias integrales? “Nada más el impacto que ocasiona el diagnóstico o noticia ya requiere una evaluación por cuidados paliativos y un abordaje psicológico que acaba de recibir la noticia lo cual lo impactó pensando que era algo leve por el dolor y resultó ser una enfermedad crónica esa mala noticia debe ser manejada por especialistas del área”,aseguró. ¿Cuáles son los tratamientos que existen? “A través de la organización Mundial de la Salud lo que se denomina medicamentos esenciales para los cuidados paliativos que son alrededor de unos 40 medicamentos que pueden ser utilizados vía oral, subcutánea, o endovenosa, tales como Morfina, Metadona, Centanilo, laxantes, antiinflamatorios no esteroideos entre otros que son tratamientos severos o potentes para calmar los dolores en el individuo”.precisó. ¿Ventajas que aporta a este tipo de cuidados? La primera ventaja es que no solo se abocan al paciente también a la familia desde el inicio de la enfermedad sino hasta el duelo los cuidados no terminan con la muerte física del paciente, sino que también va con el duelo porque la unidad de atención es la familia existe un cuidador principal que es el que se encarga de todo el acompañamiento y el manejo del paciente oncológico, igualmente las decisiones anticipadas que quiere el paciente la familia si desea que se reanime o aspectos que deben tomarse en conjunto al igual que se conversa el consentimiento informado de todo lo que se va a efectuar, ya que la consulta es de manera en conjunta con el paciente y el familiar porque a veces suele pasar que el mismo está ansioso tiene dolor y no capta las orientaciones en cambio el cuidador observa algunas situaciones y le informa al especialista que está sucediendo al respeto y cuáles serían sus dudas. En este orden de ideas, Tulio Gonzales, manifestó, que si el paciente es de cuidados paliativos es un paciente que tiene una enfermedad avanzada, estos cuidados ni adelantan ni atrasan el proceso de morir porque el ciudadano va a fallecer cuando le toque, se recuerda que los mismo es para garantizar una calidad de vida del paciente y la familia porque es muy doloroso tener sufriendo en una casa sin tener alguna alternativa, en los centros de salud se le da una terapia paliativa que va acompañado con dolor y de diferentes síntomas es una terapia de apoyo integral de soporte. ¿Cuáles son los centros de cuidados paliativos en Venezuela? En este contexto, Gonzales, indicó que “hay 15 Unidades de Cuidados Paliativos tales como: en el Distrito Capital tenemos el Oncológico Luis Razetti, el Hospital General Dr. Domingo Luciani, el Hospital Padre Machado, el Risques, el Clínico Universitario, y el de los Magallanes de Catia, el Hospital Central de Maracay, Ranuarez Balsa de Guárico, en Maturín, Margarita, Zulia y en Táchira. El especialista, afirmó, que a través de la implementación de este Programa se espera responder, a la excelencia atención de las necesidades de pacientes y familias que se atienden en la Red Hospitalaria y que presenten enfermedades graves o de riesgo vital, aplicando los principios de los Cuidados Paliativos. Los aspectos centrales en los que se basan estos principios, se define paciente Paliativo como aquel paciente de todas las edades que padece una enfermedad crónica, debilitante o amenazante, la unidad a tratar está compuesta por el Enfermo y su Familia. El plan de tratamiento debe estar construido en base a las metas y preferencias de los pacientes y familiares, los cuales con el apoyo del equipo de salud deberán ser capaces de tomar decisiones informadas. No obstante, el presidente de la Sociedad Venezolana de la Medicina Paliativa, reafirmó, que con estos aspectos centrales el Programa de Cuidados Continuos y Medicina Paliativa, busca responder tanto en el ámbito hospitalario como domiciliario a las necesidades físicas, psicológicas, espirituales y prácticas de los pacientes y sus familias. Finalmente, el Gobierno Bolivariano, a través del Sistema Público Nacional de Salud (SPNS), garantiza estas atenciones de manera gratuita y de calidad capaz de optimizar el manejo de pacientes en fases avanzadas de enfermedad en conjunto con los equipos médicos tratantes, con el objetivo es ser una herramienta complementaria para optimizar el manejo global de estos pacientes en los diversos niveles asistenciales que existen.

suministro de medicamentos aliviando el dolor físico de cada individuo hasta el tratamiento psicológico tanto para el enfermo como la familia porque se ejecuta un trabajo social y un conjunto de actividades que le permita disfrutar de la mejor manera sus últimos momentos en este mundo origen el origen etimológico de la palabra paliativo es la palabra latina pallium que significa manto o cubierta haciendo alusión al acto de aliviar síntomas o sufrimiento además la palabra latina hospitium significaba inicialmente el sentimiento cálido experimentado por huéspe y luego el lugar físico donde este sentimiento se experimentaba durante la edad media los hospicio fueron lugare de acogida para peregrinos los que muchas vece venían gravemente enfermos o moribundos asimismo esto lugare

paliativa la disciplina que en el año sería aceptada por primera vez en el mundo por otra parte en el siglo xix el alivio de síntomas fue la tarea principal del tratamiento médico ya que las enfermedades evolucionan básicamente siguiendo su historia natural igualmente la medicina cambió de orientación concentrando sus esfuerzos en descubrir las causas y curas de las enfermedade es importante resaltar que hay un gran equipo multidisciplinario que comprende por el equipo de médico incluido el especialista enfermero nutricionista psicólogo terapista trabajadora social capellán psiquiatra fisioterapeuta entre otro estos deben contar con competencias y experiencia en el manejo del paciente en la atención física y emocional en este sentido este equipo cumple un papel fundamental y reconoce que el final de la vida debe ser con dignidad respetando las opiniones de cada paciente con sus limitacione temore y angustia de igual forma estas relacione humanas son establecidas durante el cuidado y desarrollo de la enfermedad esta percepción es definida como un acto o efecto de percibir una combinación de sentido en el reconocimiento de un objeto o situación

concienciar las personas sobre este tipo de tratamientos y ayudar sobrellevar de mejor manera este tipo de terapia los profesionales de la salud centran su atención en garantizar al paciente una nueva visión holística en todo lo bueno que sembró y en darle las gracias la vida por haberle permitido disfrutar de ella así sea un breve momento además los especialistas tienen otra meta en ayudar las familias prepararse para lo inevitable y poder resignarse de la mejor manera la pérdida es por ello que este grupo familiar se somete terapia psicológicas y de trabajo social cerrando cualquier proceso emocional que guarde relación con el paciente tulio gonzález por otro lado el presidente de la sociedad venezolana de la medicina paliativa coordinador y médico cirujano tulio gonzález explicó que estos cuidado integrale están dirigido los paciente y la familia y va dirigido todo aquello paciente de enfermedade crónicas avanzada ya sea oncológica o oncológica en el caso de los oncológicos los cuidados paliativos o la medicina integral debe ser dirigida del mismo modo que se le da el diagnostico la sociedad americana recomienda que inicie esta fase cuando el paciente oncológico ya va una segunda línea esperar que este avanzado quiéne proporcionan los cuidados paliativos un equipo de multidisciplinario brinda esta atención integral donde un médico paliativo dirige el mismo con otros especialista ante mencionado dijo quiénes pueden recibir estos cuidado aquellos paciente con enfermedade crónicas ya que la misma se cura solo se controla pero va hacia la terminalidad por ejemplo un individuo que tenga insuficiencia renal o hepática trastorno neurológico es susceptible de esta atención integral ya que está relacionado vario síntomas como mareos náusea vómitos tos hipo dolor entre otros esto paciente también reciben radioterapia quimioterapia y hace que tenga dolor y ardor qué características debe poseer el paciente para recibir terapia integrale nada más el impacto que ocasiona el diagnóstico o noticia ya requiere una evaluación por cuidado paliativos y un abordaje psicológico que acaba de recibir la noticia lo cual lo impactó pensando que era algo leve por el dolor y resultó ser una enfermedad crónica esa mala noticia debe ser manejada por especialistas del cuáles son los tratamientos que existen través de la organización mundial de la salud lo que se denomina medicamentos esenciale para los cuidados paliativos que son alrededor de unos medicamento que pueden ser utilizado vía oral subcutánea o endovenosa tale como morfina metadona centanilo laxante antiinflamatorio esteroideos entre otros que son tratamiento severo o potente para calmar los dolores en el ventajas que aporta este tipo de cuidado la primera ventaja es que solo se abocan al paciente también la familia desde el inicio de la enfermedad sino hasta el duelo los cuidados terminan con la muerte física del paciente sino que también va con el duelo porque la unidad de atención es la familia existe un cuidador principal que es el que se encarga de todo el acompañamiento y el manejo del paciente oncológico igualmente las decisione anticipada que quiere el paciente la familia si desea que se reanime o aspecto que deben tomarse en conjunto al igual que se conversa el consentimiento informado de todo lo que se va efectuar ya que la consulta es de manera en conjunta con el paciente y el familiar porque vece suele pasar que el mismo está ansioso tiene dolor y capta las orientacione en cambio el cuidador observa algunas situacione y le informa al especialista que está

423399192,"La primera recomendación en ese sentido es comer el primer alimento una hora después de despertar para no prolongar el ayuno que puede derivar en problemas gastrointestinales y causar irritabilidad, desgano, falta de concentración y mareos. Sin importar la edad, las personas que no desayunan tienen una mayor probabilidad de presentar obesidad debido a que se someten a ayunos prolongados, y cuando se recibe la primera comida el cuerpo responde acumulándola como reserva de energía, explica la entidad mencionada. A esto se le suma que, de acuerdo con un estudio publicado en Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, el hambre afecta la habilidad de tomar buenas decisiones, eligiendo la gratificación instantánea sobre las metas a largo plazo. Siga leyendo: ( Sobre consumir ciertos alimentos con el estómago vacío, la dietista-nutricionista Paloma Quintana dijo al medio La Vanguardia que 'si hablamos de personas sanas, no existe ningún alimento que no deba consumirse específicamente con el estómago vacío', pero recomienda que 'cada persona observe su cuerpo y compruebe si hay algo que le siente mal y, directamente, no lo consuma en ayunas'. Eso sí, existen ciertos alimentos que pueden provocar indisposición en algunas personas, 'desde náuseas a reflujo o activación de la motilidad', cuando se ingieren con el estómago vacío. La lista de alimentos que debe evitar en el desayuno. La Federación Española de Sociedades de Nutrición, Alimentación y Dietética -Fesnad- indica que: 'todo alimento que contenga grasa saturada en exceso, ya sean productos de panadería o la comida procedente de los cárnicos procesados, así como la repostería con alta cantidad de azúcar añadida no son beneficiosos para consumir a primera hora del día'. Lo anterior se debe a que este tipo de alimentos pueden alterar los síntomas de reflujo o gastritis en personas que hayan presentado señales de estas enfermedades. Este es el listado de Frutas cítricas: A pesar de que son muy nutritivas y frecuentes en el desayuno, como sucede con la naranja, estas contienen ácido cítrico que puede producir agruras, gastritis y úlceras, según un estudio del National Food and Nutrition Institute de Polonia. Embutidos: las s alchichas, el tocino o el chorizo tienen una gran cantidad de grasa que el estómago no podrá digerir bien por las mañanas, lo que puede generar pesadez en el día. Picante: De acuerdo con Judith Torrell, dietética especialista en Obesidad y Patologías Digestivas en canalSALUD, el consumo de comidas picantes puede perjudicar la mucosa del tracto gastrointestinal propiciando náuseas, vómitos, dolor abdominal, úlceras, diarrea y hemorroides. Dulces: Productos de panadería dulces para el desayuno pueden aumentar notablemente la producción de insulina dificultando las funciones del páncreas lo que, a largo o medio plazo, podría desencadenar diabetes. Eso también incluye los cereales industriales. Plátano: Puede parecer una opción práctica y nutritiva, pero en ayunas puede aumentar la carga del sistema cardiovascular, ya que el magnesio que contiene se absorbe rápidamente. Café: es habitual que muchas personas consuman una taza de café al levantarse, sin embargo, los expertos aseguran que este hábito no es recomendable, pues esta es una bebida que aumenta la producción de ácido en el estómago, lo que puede provocar acidez estomacal, malestar y dolor abdominal. Yogur: es considerado como una de las principales fuentes de proteínas y probióticos que ayudan a mejorar la salud intestinal. Sin embargo, es recomendable evitar el consumo de este alimento antes del desayuno, debido a que contiene grandes cantidades de ácido láctico que con el estómago vacío, puede ocasionar un malestar gastrointestinal.",9578,la primera recomendación en ese sentido es comer el primer alimento una hora después de despertar para prolongar el ayuno que puede derivar en problemas gastrointestinales y causar irritabilidad desgano falta de concentración y mareos sin importar la edad las personas que desayunan tienen una mayor probabilidad de presentar obesidad debido que se someten ayunos prolongado y cuando se recibe la primera comida el cuerpo responde acumulándola como reserva de energía explica la entidad mencionada esto se le suma que de acuerdo con un estudio publicado en psychonomic bulletin review el hambre afecta la habilidad de tomar buenas decisione eligiendo la gratificación instantánea sobre las meta largo plazo siga leyendo sobre consumir ciertos alimentos con el estómago vacío la dietista nutricionista paloma quintana dijo al medio la vanguardia que si hablamos de personas sanas existe ningún alimento que deba consumirse específicamente con el estómago vacío pero recomienda que cada persona observe su cuerpo y compruebe si hay algo que le siente mal y directamente lo consuma en ayuna eso sí existen ciertos alimentos que pueden provocar indisposición en algunas persona desde náusea reflujo o activación de la motilidad cuando se ingieren con el estómago vacío la lista de alimentos que debe evitar en el desayuno la federación española de sociedades de nutrición alimentación y dietética indica que todo alimento que contenga grasa saturada en exceso ya sean productos de panadería o la comida procedente de los cárnicos procesados así como la repostería con alta cantidad de azúcar añadida son beneficiosos para consumir primera hora del día lo anterior se debe que este tipo de alimentos pueden alterar los síntomas de reflujo o gastritis en personas que hayan presentado señales de estas enfermedade este es el listado de frutas cítrica pesar de que son muy nutritivas y frecuente en el desayuno como sucede con la naranja estas contienen ácido cítrico que puede producir agruras gastritis y úlceras según un estudio del national food nutrition institute de polonia embutido las s alchichas el tocino o el chorizo tienen una gran cantidad de grasa que el estómago podrá digerir bien por las mañanas lo que puede generar pesadez en el día picante de acuerdo con judith torrell dietética especialista en obesidad y patologías digestivas en canalsalud el consumo de comidas picante puede perjudicar la mucosa del tracto gastrointestinal propiciando náusea vómito dolor abdominal úlcera diarrea y hemorroide dulce productos de panadería dulce para el desayuno pueden aumentar notablemente la producción de insulina dificultando las funciones del páncreas lo que largo o medio plazo podría desencadenar diabete eso también incluye los cereales industriale plátano puede parecer una opción práctica y nutritiva pero en ayuna puede aumentar la carga del sistema cardiovascular ya que el magnesio que contiene se absorbe rápidamente café es habitual que muchas personas consuman una taza de café al levantarse sin embargo los expertos aseguran que este hábito es recomendable pues esta es una bebida que aumenta la producción de ácido en el estómago lo que puede provocar acidez estomacal malestar y dolor abdominal yogur es considerado como una de las principales fuente de proteínas y probióticos que ayudan mejorar la salud intestinal sin embargo es recomendable evitar el consumo de este alimento ante del desayuno debido que contiene grande cantidade de ácido láctico que con el estómago vacío puede ocasionar un malestar gastrointestinal
423398583,"Newswise — Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, conducted a multicenter comprehensive retrospective analysis to assess the effectiveness and safety of primary single-agent and combination therapies in treating adult patients with relapsed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In the treatment of ITP, glucocorticoids and IVIg are considered the primary therapeutic options. Typically, clinicians opt for either of these treatments when addressing ITP cases. The research pertaining to the combined utilization of these two medications has predominantly focused on emergency situations and cases related to ITP during pregnancy. There has been limited investigation into the treatment of relapsed ITP in adult patients. This study, which involved a retrospective examination of clinical cases from multiple centers, represents the first attempt to compare the effectiveness of these three treatment modalities in enhancing platelet counts among adult relapsed ITP patients. The findings from this research serve as a valuable reference for clinicians engaged in the management of ITP. Professor Zhang Lei highlighted, 'Our study unveiled a remarkable finding: the combination therapy of IVIg and glucocorticoids in treating adult relapsed ITP patients led to a complete response (CR) rate of 71.83% within 7 days, outperforming the IVIg group (43.48%) and the glucocorticoid group (23.08%). Moreover, the rate of improvement in platelet count and the daily proportions reaching 30×10 9 /L, 50×10 9 /L, and 100×10 9 /L in the combination therapy group significantly differed from those in each single-agent group. Therefore, for relapsed persistent and chronic ITP patients, especially those requiring a rapid increase in platelet levels, relying solely on glucocorticoid medication might not be the most effective strategy. Combining IVIg to achieve superior efficacy is advisable. While patients responded similarly to IVIg and glucocorticoid drugs, it's noteworthy that the IVIg group exhibited a faster onset of action and superior treatment efficacy compared to the glucocorticoid group. Hence, when considering first-line single-agent therapy for adult relapsed ITP patients, prioritizing IVIg treatment is recommended.' Professor Zhang Lei further stressed, 'With the continuous advancement of biopharmaceutical technology, a plethora of new drugs and targeted therapies has expanded the clinical avenues for ITP patients. However, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the optimal medication sequence, leading more patients to prefer newer drugs and targeted therapies like TPO-RA, rituximab, Syk inhibitors, and Fcγ receptor inhibitors upon relapse. This diversity has introduced significant variations in ITP relapse treatments. Our findings indicate that for relapsed persistent and chronic ITP patients, the combination therapy approach involving first-line drugs offers advantages in both onset time and treatment efficacy. This rapid, stable, and high CR rate clinical efficacy is particularly beneficial for patients with low platelet counts and accompanying bleeding symptoms. Combination therapy can safely and effectively elevate platelet counts swiftly, achieving hemostasis and reducing the necessity for platelet transfusions.' Given that this study is retrospective, its level of evidence falls below that of prospective research. Consequently, it remains essential for clinical practitioners to make treatment choices in line with their clinical expertise and the unique circumstances of their patients. Furthermore, there is an aspiration that clinical research centers throughout the country will engage in more prospective studies for patients in similar situations in the future.

Opening up on how he manages his own struggles, the Deadpool star told Page Six, “Not always great, to be honest.” “I certainly have my own little rituals and those kinds of things that help me stay grounded and keep my mind from spinning out of control,” he elaborated. “Sometimes I’m really good at it, sometimes I’m not,” he added. To calm his mind and take time for himself, Ryan turns to “meditation” He revealed, “I tend to overbook myself when I’m spiraling that way.” “I’m sort of aware of that stuff and I manage it as well as you can,” he explained. Ryan has previously been candid about his anxiety, telling CBS Sunday Mornings in 2022: 'I've had anxiety my whole life really. And you know, I feel like I have two parts of my personality, that one takes over when that happens,' 'When I would go out on, like, Letterman, back in the day, I was nervous. But I remember I'd be standing backstage before the curtain would open, and I would think to myself, 'I'm gonna die. I'm literally gonna die here. The curtain's gonna open and I'm just gonna be, I'm just gonna be a symphony of vomit,' just, like, something horrible's gonna happen!' he said of his anxiety. He explained further: 'But as soon as that curtain opens — and this happens in my work a lot too — it's like this little guy takes over. And he's like, 'I got this. You're cool.'

423369842,"Lamentablemente el alpinismo vuelve a ser centro de una tragedia. En este caso fue la montaña Shisha Pangma, una de las 14 más altas del mundo, la que acabó con la vida de dos jóvenes estadounidenses y dos experimentados sherpas, uno de ellos considerado como uno de los mejores en su labor, después de que dos avalanchas los tomaran por sorpresa. Para comprender las claves de esta tragedia ocurrida en los Himalayas hay que entender primero qué es la carrera de los 14 ochomiles. Se trata de un desafío que intentan concretar los mejores montañistas del mundo y que consiste en subir las 14 cimas más altas del planeta (las que superan los 8 mil metros de altura) en el menor tiempo posible. Eso es exactamente lo que estaban buscando Anna Gutu y Gina Marie Rzucidlo , quienes ya había conseguido completar 13 de ellos y solo les restaba el Shisha Pangma. Te puede interesar: Los expertos del Barcelona, sorprendidos al ver jugar a Alan Varela: 'Es muy interesante' El récord actual es de la noruega Kristin Harila quien este año logró hacerlos en apenas 92 días, prácticamente la mitad de la marca anterior. Justamente, ella logró semejante hazaña acompañada de Tenjen ‘Lama’ Sherpa, quien fue declarado muerto en las últimas horas, siendo una de las cuatro víctimas fatales de la tragedia del fin de semana. Las alpinistas norteamericanas buscaban además ser las primeras mujeres estadounidenses en completar el desafío, pero el mal tiempo acabó con sus vidas. Según informó The Himalayan Times , el clima no era el ideal para subir a la cima, pero hubo acuerdo entre los montañistas de llegar de todos modos. Fue así que una primera avalancha golpeó a Anna Gutu y Mingmar Sherpa el sábado cerca de las 11 AM cuando se encontraban a unos 7.800 metros , mientras que la segunda ocurrió por la tarde , casi en la misma zona, y sorprendió a Gina Marie Rzucidlo y Tenjen ‘Lama’ Sherpa. Los desprendimientos hirieron además a algunos nepalíes de la zona y por eso las 52 personas que realizaban la expedición en equipos optaron por regresar a campo base para protegerse. Al no tener noticias sobre los otros 4 que continuaron, se informó a las autoridades para que se inicie el rescate. Teniendo en cuenta la urgencia de la situación, los equipos de rescate nepalíes optaron en primer término por una operación en helicópteros, sin embargo hubo problemas burocráticos con las autoridades chinas , según señala el portal Desnivel, y eso impidió el despegue. Es que la montaña Shisha Pangma se encuentra en la frontera entre Nepal y el Tibet, anexado a China, por lo que la autorización de vuelos transfronterizos no es sencilla en esa zona. Se procedió entonces a un rescate a pie encabezado por Mingma G , máximo responsable de la agencia Imagine Nepal . Justamente él, junto a cinco sherpas, ayudaron a varios heridos a llegar a la base, pero el terreno estaba tan complicado por los aludes y el mal clima que sufrió una caída de 160 metros , según se informó el domingo 8 de octubre, que le provocó una hemorragia en la cabeza producto del golpe. Afortunadamente, se encuentra fuera de peligro. Después de algunos días de intensas búsquedas, que permitieron encontrar los cuerpos de Anna Gutu y Mingmar Sherpa , las autoridades dieron por muertos a los otros dos desaparecidos. Gina Marie , nacida en Nueva York pero establecida en Massachusetts, había emprendido este proyecto con motivo de un desafío personal, pero además para alzar la voz de las mujeres en Irán. Incluso, llevaba una bandera de esa nación que planeaba hacer flamear en su último pico. Los 14 ochomiles: El Everest (8,848 metros) - Frontera entre Nepal y China (Tíbet) K2 (8,611 metros) - Frontera entre China y Pakistán. Kanchenjunga (8,586 metros) - Frontera entre Nepal e India.

Una decisione clamorosa che ha sollevato più di un dubbio sul futuro del punto nascite del presidio di via Cerri, dove negli ultimi anni si sono ridotti significativamente i parti e che ha anche acceso i riflettori sull’emorragia di personale medico e infermieristico all’interno dell’ospedale di Merate e anche di Lecco. Pur non nascondendo il proprio dispiacere per la scelta presa dall’ormai ex primaria Dell’Anna, le ostetriche e le Oss del reparto di Ostetricia e Ginecologia meratese hanno puntualizzato di rispettare questa decisione manifestando il desiderio 'di vederla sempre qui con noi, per continuare a veder realizzare i progetti iniziati in questi mesi e che sono rivolti a tutte le 'età' delle donne'.

Finora non ci siamo mai espresse ma, avendo saputo della decisione presa dalla Dottoressa, vogliamo esprimere pubblicamente la stima e la solidarietà che nutriamo nei suoi confronti. La Dottoressa ha manifestato doti quali la capacità di ascolto, l’umanità e la valorizzazione di ogni figura professionale che opera nel Dipartimento Materno Infantile ; doti che, accompagnate da un grande entusiasmo e impegno lavorativo, concorrono alla buona riuscita dell’obiettivo del nostro reparto: un degno accoglimento di ogni nuovo nato. Tiziana Dell’Anna si è inoltre spesa con grande competenza nel promuovere e r ilanciare il Punto Nascita di Merate e, grazie a lei, la donna è la protagonista del 'percorso nascita' ed è supportata fino in fondo nelle sue scelte. Sempre grazie alla Primaria, noi Ostetriche possiamo esprimere al meglio le nostre competenze assistenziali: accogliere, accudire, curare, proteggere. È dal connubio tra la figura della donna protagonista dell’evento nascita e la professionalità dell’Ostetrica che è emersa la gratitudine dell’utenza per una nascita umanizzata, nonché rispettosa dei tempi e dei bisogni soggettivi in questo delicato e significativo momento, quello nel quale ogni essere umano si affaccia alla vita. Alla luce di tutto ciò, siamo veramente dispiaciute per la sua decisione, ma rispettiamo la sua scelta con il vivo desiderio di vederla sempre qui con noi, per continuare a veder realizzare i progetti iniziati in questi mesi e che sono rivolti a tutte le 'età' delle donne.

423353295,"LECCE - Arriva il proscioglimento per una ginecologa finita sotto inchiesta per la morte di una paziente. Il gup Angelo Zizzari, al termine dell’udienza preliminare, ha disposto il non luogo a procedere “per non aver commesso il fatto” in favore della dottoressa, in servizio all’epoca dei fatti, presso l’ospedale di Gallipoli. Dunque non ci sarà alcun processo a carico della ginecologa, dopo la richiesta di rinvio a giudizio della Procura. Il gup Zizzari ha però disposto la trasmissione degli atti al pubblico ministero per accertare altre eventuali responsabilità per la morte della donna. La decisione del giudice è maturata sulla scorta di una perizia medico-legale, disposta nella scorsa udienza, che avrebbe escluso eventuali negligenze da parte della dottoressa che rispondeva dell’ipotesi di reato di responsabilità colposa per morte o lesioni in ambito sanitario. La stessa perizia, non avrebbe però escluso eventuali responsabilità da parte del personale medico e paramedico del pronto soccorso che prestò i primi aiuti alla paziente. I dubbi riguardano, in particolare, la tempestività dei soccorsi. Intanto, in una scorsa udienza, celebratasi nel febbraio scorso, il marito della vittima si era costituito parte civile con l’avvocato Giulio Bray, invocando un maxi risarcimento del danno di 800mila euro. Il giudice, però, come detto, ha deciso di disporre una perizia medico-legale per effettuare accertamenti specifici, all’esito della quale ha stabilito il proscioglimento della dottoressa. I fatti risalgono al mese di giugno del 2021. In base all’ipotesi accusatoria, la giovane mamma si era rivolta alla ginecologa che le aveva diagnosticato, tramite ecografia, un voluminoso fibroma della parete anteriore dell’utero di circa 3 centimetri. La dottoressa, però, si sarebbe limitata a consigliare di eseguire il dosaggio della gonadotropina cronica beta (proteina ad attività ormonale prodotta dall’embrione ed utilizzata per la diagnosi dello stato di gravidanza). E non avrebbe disposto alcun ulteriore accertamento per verificare se fossero presenti gravidanze extrauterine. Stando sempre all’ipotesi accusatoria, dunque, non sarebbe stata diagnosticata, in tempo utile, una gravidanza interstiziale che avrebbe poi provocato la morte della donna per uno shock emorragico. Come detto, però, già nel corso dell’udienza preliminare sono cadute le accuse nei confronti della dottoressa.

423350586,"See our Privacy Notice ITV Emmerdale fans are speculating over who'll die in the car crash which finished off the Tuesday night episode of Super Soap Week. ITV soap fans saw Chloe crash her car, with Charity Dingle and Mack as her passengers, and the episode ended with a cliffhanger of Mack picking who to save. He grabbed one hand - with fans issuing predictions online. But now a new theory on Twitter, now renamed by Elon Musk as X, says Mack himself could die. Tom tweeted: 'I think we could have a shock delayed death, Mack dying with internal bleeding from the car holding.' Alley wrote: 'I thought the rolling car landed very neatly - better than a lot of people manage to park! I thought at first 'those aren't Chloe's nails' then I thought 'those aren't Charity's wrists they look too young' and came to the conclusion that Mack has left both of them to perish and saved a mannequin instead. 'What's happened to the van which ploughed into them - does nobody care about random extras? Lydia and Sam were heartbreaking and the moment when Belle said 'we believe you' nearly did for me... Mandy however can do one with her troublemaking and stirring. Cain and Caleb and Aaron and Chas - blah, blah, blah. If he wants to go then let him. 'Oooh - Nate saw the Gangster - I spy trouble ahead. Can't see what Sunni s getting his knickers in a twist about. He's not the one who was abandoned.' Another said: 'Chloe pretended she was taking Charity back, said she had gone the wrong way, presumably to give her a chance to tell Charity a few home truths!' Another asked: 'There was a lot of errors tonight, like how could Mack open his car door when it was that side that took the impact of that van?'

Οι πετσέτες θα πρέπει να πλένονται τακτικά, αλλά μερικές φορές, μπορεί κάποιοι να τις αφήνουν λίγο περισσότερο από τον συνιστώμενο χρόνο, καθώς πιστεύουν ότι δεν είναι το πιο σημαντικό πράγμα στην ατζέντα τους. Έρευνα στη Βρετανία σοκάρει. Σύμφωνα με πρόσφατη έρευνα, το 3% των Βρετανών πλένουν τις πετσέτες τους μόνο μία φορά το χρόνο, και η αλήθεια σοκάρει τόσο για το γεγονός όσο και με τις συνέπειες που μπορεί να έχει αυτή η συνθήκη για την υγεία. Αποδεικνύεται ότι πολλοί άνθρωποι θα πρέπει να αρχίσουν να παίρνουν πιο σοβαρά το πλύσιμο των πετσετών τους. Εάν δεν πλένεις τακτικά τις πετσέτες σου- οι ειδικοί συνιστούν να πλένεις κάθε τρεις χρήσεις- θα μπορούσες να θέσεις τον εαυτό σας σε κίνδυνο, να αρρωστήσεις, ακόμη και να υποφέρεις από δυσάρεστες μολύνσεις. Αυτό οφείλεται στα βακτήρια που φιλοξενούνται στις πετσέτες εάν δεν πλένονται αρκετά συχνά. Το trend του TikTok με το αλατόνερο δεν είναι τόσο ασφαλές και οι ειδικοί εξηγούν γιατί. Μια μελέτη του 2018 από τον μικροβιολόγο Charles Gerba, του Πανεπιστημίου της Αριζόνα, απέδειξε ότι σχεδόν το 90% των πετσετών μπάνιου ήταν μολυσμένες με κολοβακτηρίδια, τα οποία υπάρχουν στα κόπρανα, και περίπου το 14% έφεραν E.coli. Τα προβλήματα υγείας που μπορεί να προκληθούν από το E.coli περιλαμβάνουν διάρροια, λοιμώξεις του ουροποιητικού συστήματος, αναπνευστικές ασθένειες και λοιμώξεις όπως μηνιγγίτιδα σε σοβαρές περιπτώσεις, σύμφωνα με το Κέντρο Ελέγχου και Πρόληψης Νοσημάτων (CDC) - οπότε αντιλαμβάνεται κανείς τη σημαντικότητα της σωστής καθαριότητας της πετσέτας.

En este artículo, te compartimos los tipos más comunes de cáncer que afectan a perros y gatos. El portal web del Hospital Veterinario Puchol explica que los animales no están exentos de este tipo de enfermedades. De hecho, 'casi el 50 % de los fallecimientos que se producen en las mascotas de más de 10 años de edad se deben al cáncer', señala. Los expertos explican que los humanos y las mascotas prácticamente tenemos los mismos tipos de cáncer y más o menos en las mismas proporciones, lo que varía en la mayoría de casos son las causas que lo producen. En los últimos años, la medicina veterinaria ha avanzado a pasos agigantados, ahora existen diversos métodos de detección de enfermedades que los especialistas pueden implementar en caso de sospechas o sintomatologías extrañas. Al igual que en los seres humanos, la detección del cáncer en sus etapas más tempranas es fundamental para evitar una enfermedad muy grave y una muerte prematura del animal. Por eso, se recomienda a los dueños de mascotas estar atentos a las siguientes señales: Cualquier cambio en la forma o hinchazón; Protuberancia o bulto en cualquier parte del cuerpo; Heridas que no terminan de cicatrizar; Vómitos y/o diarreas; Dificultad respiratoria; Dificultad para tragar; Apatía; Cambios en la cantidad de comida que ingiere; Cambios en la cantidad de agua que bebe; Pérdida de peso; Palidez de mucosas; Mal aspecto del pelaje; En general, tristeza y pérdida de interés 'Los perros mayores padecen en general con mayor frecuencia cáncer, y como ya hemos indicado, lamentablemente es una de las causas más frecuentes de mortalidad a partir de 10 años', señala el portal citado.

Diversos estudios han establecido que los perros de razas como Bóxer, Golden Retriever, Pastor Alemán y Rottweiler son más propensos a padecer algunas de estas patologías. 'No hay que olvidar que los mestizos de las razas con mayor predisposición también pueden padecer dichas enfermedades con mayor frecuencia'.

During Wednesday's night instalment, Mackenzie Boyd (Lawrence Robb) decided to save Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) instead of the mother of his child. Mackenzie was left distraught as he realised the repercussions of his actions. However, in an unexpected twist, Mack and Charity discovered Chloe was still alive when they reached the bottom of the cliff. 'Chloe, I don't know whether you can hear me, but those guys are going to look after you,' Mack reassured as the paramedics took the young mum away on a stretcher. 'We'll be right behind you, I am going to look after Reuben, he's going to want to give you a massive hug as soon as he sees you. 'I've got everything under control, I promise.'

423393916,"Como una manera de crear conciencia, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), desplegó una campaña para prevenir la hemorragia postparto. Así, la iniciativa busca salvar la vida de las madres y evitar una pérdida para las familias. Por esta razón, la OMS lanzó una guía para reducir las hemorragias postparto. Según Naciones Unidas, cada dos minutos muere una mujer por causas relacionadas con complicaciones derivadas por una hemorragia. Cabe mencionar que en Bolivia, Guatemala, Haití, Perú y República Dominicana, la hemorragia obstétrica es la primera causa de muerte materna. En resumen, a pesar de ser prevenible, las hemorragias postparto provocan unas 70.000 muertes al año. Del mismo modo, 85% de las muertes se producen en el África subsahariana y Asia meridional. Recordemos que los factores de riesgo están la anemia, las anomalías placentarias, las infecciones y preeclampsia. Cuándo se considera una hemorragia postparto. De acuerdo con el manual de salud de la , la hemorragia postparto 'es un sangrado más intenso de lo normal después del nacimiento de un bebé. Entre 1 y 5 de cada 100 mujeres tienen hemorragia posparto. Es más probable que suceda con un nacimiento por cesárea. Por lo general, ocurre después de que sale la placenta, pero puede suceder más adelante' 'El sangrado severo durante el parto es una de las causas más comunes de mortalidad materna, pero es altamente prevenible y tratable', explicó el director general de la OMS, el doctor Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Al respecto, al momento del nacimiento, 'el útero normalmente se contrae y expulsa la placenta. Una vez expulsada, las contracciones ayudan a presionar los vasos sanguíneos en la zona en la que estaba adherida. Si el útero no se contrae con la fuerza suficiente, los vasos sanguíneos sangran libremente. Esta es la causa más común de hemorragia posparto. También es posible que haya sangrado si quedan adheridos pequeños fragmentos de placenta' Igualmente, la hemorragia posparto puede ser producido por: -Un desgarro en el cuello del útero o en los tejidos de la vagina. -Un desgarro en los vasos sanguíneos del útero. -Sangrado en una zona o espacio de tejido oculto en la pelvis. Esta masa de sangre se llama hematoma.

Según el organismo, a pesar de ser prevenibles y tratables, las hemorragias postparto provocan unas 70 mil muertes al año. Para las que sobreviven, pueden causar discapacidades y traumas psicológicos que duran años. Detalla que más del 85 por ciento de las muertes se producen en el África subsahariana y Asia meridional. Entre los factores de riesgo están la anemia, las anomalías placentarias y otras complicaciones del embarazo, como infecciones y preclampsia. La hoja de ruta pretende ayudar a los países a abordar las marcadas diferencias en los resultados de supervivencia, que reflejan grandes desigualdades en el acceso a los servicios sanitarios esenciales. Muchos factores de riesgo pueden controlarse con una atención prenatal de calidad, que incluya el acceso a ecografías, y un seguimiento eficaz en las horas posteriores al parto.

423397386,"A medida que aumentan las opciones de alimentos sin gluten, puede resultar difícil decidir incluirlo o no en la alimentación. El gluten es una proteína que se encuentra en cereales, como el trigo, la cebada y el centeno. En la enfermedad celiaca, la ingesta de gluten desencadena una reacción autoinmune que provoca daño celular en el intestino delgado. Esto, a su vez, puede causar diarrea, fatiga, pérdida de peso, hinchazón, anemia y otros problemas, y derivar en complicaciones graves. De otro lado, está la intolerancia al gluten que es más común y se compara con la intolerancia a los lácteos, la cebolla o el ajo. «En la intolerancia al gluten no hay daño celular ni inflamación. Es más bien una sensibilidad. Si al consumir gluten se produce una reacción inmediata, como diarrea, es más probable que se trate de intolerancia al gluten y no de enfermedad celiaca, ya que, en la segunda, se trata de un proceso lento que no se suele sentir inmediatamente», explica el Dr. Sarmed Sami, gastroenterólogo de Clínica Mayo en Londres. De acuerdo con el especialista, la mayoría de las personas no tienen necesidad de eliminar por completo los alimentos que contienen gluten ya que no se ha demostrado ningún beneficio de hacerlo. Un signo de que una persona tiene intolerancia al gluten o celiaquía es la presencia de uno o más síntomas gastrointestinales, como diarrea, hinchazón o acidez estomacal, que disminuyen o desaparecen si se elimina el gluten de la dieta y aparecen nuevamente si la persona vuelve a comer alimentos con gluten. Si esto ocurre, es importante hacerse pruebas en caso de que se trate de una celiaquía más grave, afirma el Dr. Sami. Para tratar la intolerancia al gluten basta con reducir el consumo de alimentos que lo contienen, en lugar de eliminarlos por completo. «Depende del grado de intolerancia. A algunas personas les basta con reducir a la mitad la ingesta de gluten, mientras que otras necesitan reducir en mayor medida. Es diferente de la celiaquía, en la que se debe evitar el gluten de forma completa y estricta», añade. El diagnóstico de la celiaquía suele comenzar con un análisis de sangre para determinar si el organismo considera el gluten como un invasor y genera niveles elevados de anticuerpos para protegerse. Si el análisis de sangre da un resultado positivo, se usa una prueba por imágenes llamada endoscopia para realizar biopsias y verificar si hay daños en el intestino delgado. «Por lo general, recomendamos que las personas no sigan una dieta sin gluten si se les realizan pruebas de celiaquía, porque puede derivar en resultados falsos negativos en el análisis de sangre», afirma el Dr. Sami. Para la mayoría de los pacientes con un diagnóstico de celiaquía, la eliminación del gluten mantiene esta enfermedad bajo control, sin embargo, sin un diagnóstico de celiaquía, no hay motivos para eliminar el gluten. «No hay evidencia de que una dieta sin gluten por sí misma sea más saludable. Lo importante no es el gluten. Si se toma de ejemplo una galleta, tiene más que ver con la grasa y el azúcar de la galleta que con el gluten».",9578,medida que aumentan las opcione de alimentos sin gluten puede resultar difícil decidir incluirlo o en la alimentación el gluten es una proteína que se encuentra en cereale como el trigo la cebada y el centeno en la enfermedad celiaca la ingesta de gluten desencadena una reacción autoinmune que provoca daño celular en el intestino delgado esto su vez puede causar diarrea fatiga pérdida de peso hinchazón anemia y otros problemas y derivar en complicacione grave de otro lado está la intolerancia al gluten que es más común y se compara con la intolerancia los lácteos la cebolla o el ajo en la intolerancia al gluten hay daño celular ni inflamación es más bien una sensibilidad si al consumir gluten se produce una reacción inmediata como diarrea es más probable que se trate de intolerancia al gluten y de enfermedad celiaca ya que en la segunda se trata de un proceso lento que se suele sentir inmediatamente explica el sarmed sami gastroenterólogo de clínica mayo en londres de acuerdo con el especialista la mayoría de las personas tienen necesidad de eliminar por completo los alimentos que contienen gluten ya que se ha demostrado ningún beneficio de hacerlo un signo de que una persona tiene intolerancia al gluten o celiaquía es la presencia de uno o más síntoma gastrointestinales como diarrea hinchazón o acidez estomacal que disminuyen o desaparecen si se elimina el gluten de la dieta y aparecen nuevamente si la persona vuelve comer alimentos con gluten si esto ocurre es importante hacerse pruebas en caso de que se trate de una celiaquía más grave afirma el sami para tratar la intolerancia al gluten basta con reducir el consumo de alimentos que lo contienen en lugar de eliminarlos por completo depende del grado de intolerancia alguna personas les basta con reducir la mitad la ingesta de gluten mientras que otras necesitan reducir en mayor medida es diferente de la celiaquía en la que se debe evitar el gluten de forma completa y estricta añade el diagnóstico de la celiaquía suele comenzar con un análisis de sangre para determinar si el organismo considera el gluten como un invasor y genera niveles elevado de anticuerpos para protegerse si el análisis de sangre da un resultado positivo se usa una prueba por imágene llamada endoscopia para realizar biopsias y verificar si hay daños en el intestino delgado por lo general recomendamo que las personas sigan una dieta sin gluten si se les realizan pruebas de celiaquía porque puede derivar en resultados falsos negativos en el análisis de sangre afirma el sami para la mayoría de los paciente con un diagnóstico de celiaquía la eliminación del gluten mantiene esta enfermedad bajo control sin embargo sin un diagnóstico de celiaquía hay motivos para eliminar el gluten hay evidencia de que una dieta sin gluten por sí misma sea más saludable lo importante es el gluten si se toma de ejemplo una galleta tiene más que ver con la grasa y el azúcar de la galleta que con el gluten

423377674,"Brock McLean says it was 'almost destiny' that he would aspire to play in the Australian Football League , following in the footsteps of several family members. 'I was very much an all-or-nothing person – everything I did was absolutely flat out,' he says. McLean’s AFL career lasted over a decade. From the beginning, he loved pushing his body to the limit, training up to 20 times a week. After several injuries, he went on a strict diet 'just to lose a few kilos' in a bid to reduce injury risk. 'And it helped: my performance was really good. It reinforced to me that that was the right thing.' Gradually, McLean became obsessed with food: weighing every item, and weighing himself before and after he ate. He believed this focus was giving him an edge as a footballer. 'Everything was tied up in that … without football, I felt completely worthless.' Then a coach asked him to lose more weight to improve his leg speed, which his nutritionist warned against. But, worried over time lost to injuries, McLean wanted to do everything to ensure he could play. He deprived himself of certain foods, entering a cycle of binge-eating, suffering terrible guilt, and frequently making himself vomit. 'I’d panic if I jumped on the scales and was [a certain weight], I’d think ‘oh God, I’m putting on weight, I’m not going to play’ … I was dealing with depression, and it was around then that suicidal ideation became a problem.' He attempted suicide on 23 August 2017. 'I’m very lucky that I was found when I was, by my partner … I realised I needed to keep seeing a psychologist and keep working on my issues.' Helen Bird, education services manager at the Butterfly foundation, an eating disorder charity, says there’s growing recognition of the prevalence of disordered eating in sports – which can affect players at any level – and an increasing number of sports groups are approaching them for support. The AFL and AFLW dropped skinfold testing, which involves using calipers to measure the thickness of skin and underlying fat at specific places on the body, for draft prospects in 2021 . Now experts are questioning the usefulness of measures such as weight and body composition as indicators of athletic performance – and health more broadly. The Compeat Performance team, which provides nutrition support to the Matildas, stopped weighing players two years ago – saying it came at the cost of player performance, and didn’t have a clear purpose. Photograph: Darren England/AAP. In 2022, the authors of a small study of 22 AFLW players called for practitioners to prioritise factors such as aerobic fitness and muscular power, after finding no significant relationship between pre-season body composition measures and match performance. The Compeat Performance team, which provides nutrition support to the Matildas, stopped weighing players or monitoring body composition two years ago – saying the metrics often came at the cost of player performance, and didn’t have a clear purpose. There remains a widespread emphasis on weight and performance in many areas of sport, Compeat co-CEO Alicia Edge says. 'When we’re looking at the research, the only real connection we’ve got is that there’s a relationship between lean mass and our ability to perform, but no clear connection when we’re looking at body fat,' says Edge, an advanced sports dietitian. 'So if we’re looking at that cultural [idea] of always aiming for ‘lighter is better’, we’re basing that on our own assumptions rather than what the research is telling us.' Edge and Compeat co-CEO Dan Edge began questioning the role of these measures back in 2016. 'We started to fully appreciate that whenever we’re working with weight or body composition, that’s a lag measure, it’s a symptom. If the problem is perceived to be body fat, or whatever it may be, ‘eat less or train more’ is a really over-simplified solution that doesn’t appreciate the person behind the data.' Weight and body composition can still be discussed, Edge says. But they have developed a new screening tool to track progress without those metrics, which also helps them understand clients’ relationships with food and other influences on their health behaviours. 'When we’re getting to know someone, we’re considering all those influences … mental, social, financial, and physical wellbeing – along with their occupation, culture, and environment.' Focusing on controlling something uncontrollable can fuel anxiety, she adds, because body weight and composition aren’t predictable outcomes. Prof Amanda Salis of the University of Western Australia says: 'Body size is influenced by a combination of dozens, if not hundreds of things.' 'You’ve got major players like genetics, and the environment – the food, physical activity, the stress environment … We also have our past and emotions – if someone goes through adverse childhood experiences, that plays out in how much they eat, move, and their stress, and all have an impact on the size we exist in.' She says that while many assume size comes down to 'personal choice and willpower', in reality 'it’s much more complex than it’s often made out to be'. Salis has authored several books on weight management and is now running a clinical weight loss trial using total meal replacement products, an approach she stresses should not be adopted without medical supervision. BMI – a calculation with roots in the development of eugenics – is only relevant at a population level. Salis says it won’t provide information on someone’s metabolic health, which should be the priority. 'Even someone who might have a very high BMI, a doctor might see no, they haven’t got the risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, etc. when looking at their blood sugar or glucose levels for example. 'There’s some good evidence that a waist circumference above a certain number is likely to be associated with metabolic diseases, compared to having a waist below a certain number, and it’s different according to age and sex and things, but it’s not an absolute indicator, nor is BMI … it’s all just probabilistic.' The recent National Eating Disorders Strategy flags weight stigma as a risk to physical and mental health. However, experts have pointed to a disconnect between the research and ‘weight-centric’ resources available online (including from the federal government ), many of which still include BMI calculators. Feeling judged for any reason, including body size, can lead people to avoid seeking healthcare, says Canberra-based GP Dr Liz Sturgiss. I like to focus on, ‘what’s life like at the moment?’ … not just the numbers 'We know women with larger bodies have lower rates of cervical screening, they have fewer presentations for breast screening. All these things mean that if you have a bigger body, you’ll have poorer health outcomes than someone in a smaller body,' says Sturgiss, who is also a primary care researcher at Monash University. Advanced dietitian Dr Fiona Willer adds that weight stigma may also lead people to celebrate any weight loss, whereas the underlying causes may be sinister. 'The overlap between people who are intentionally losing weight and unintentionally losing weight can be quite significant. Somebody can be suffering from a form of cancer and losing weight because of that, but because they’re also trying to diet at the same time, they don’t realise it’s not the diet, it’s that they’re actually dying and no one’s picked it up yet.' Sturgiss’ echoes that making assumptions about health based on body size comes with risks for any patient, and she warns against 'cheering the scales'. Many of her patients are from low-income groups and have food insecurity, so weight loss may prompt concerns of malnutrition. Usually the most relevant thing about somebody’s high body weight is how they’ve been treated because of it 'If someone is binging on laxatives, exercising in unhelpful ways, they have no money for food – none of those things are good,' Sturgiss says. She only weighs patients if they are happy to be weighed, as one of several measures – with the focus on any changes over time, and understanding the driving forces. 'I like to focus on, ‘what’s life like at the moment?’ … not just the numbers.' 'There are plenty of people who have very low body weights and really poor cardiovascular outcomes for all kinds of reasons. So any time we put out health messaging, either in an individual consultation or in public health messaging, that if your body’s not large you’re fine … that’s really unhelpful.' If a patient has ‘adiposity’ or body fat causing health issues – the WHO definition for obesity or overweight that Sturgiss uses – and wants to address that, she says they should be supported. 'But we live in a society incredibly biased against people who have larger bodies … and you don’t want to be supporting any kind of industry that involves body shaming, so it’s a difficult line to walk.' Willer, who runs a business training health professionals in size-inclusive approaches, says people with bigger bodies often anticipate their health professional will raise the topic of weight, and fear healthcare will be ‘gate-kept’ due to their size. ‘No matter what you’re good at, no matter what you’re bad at, you’re a human being and you’re worthy of love and compassion,’ says Brock McLean, much healthier now, pictured with his wife, Stephanie. Photograph: Brock McLean. 'Size inclusive practice understands that weight is not nothing – but usually the most relevant thing about somebody’s high body weight is how they’ve been treated because of it. 'Size inclusive practice supports someone in the body they have, at that time, and looks for treatments for whatever their presenting complaint is that don’t require starvation or weight change prior to addressing the health condition they’ve presented with.' Dr Mark Morgan, chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners quality care expert committee, is overseeing the new edition of the Red Book, which will include updated guidelines for GPs on screening for weight-related health issues. He echoes that it’s crucial everyone feels respected when attending general practice, noting the words ‘overweight’ and ‘obesity’ have specific definitions in a medical context so clinicians, researchers and epidemiologists can use a common language. But, 'for individuals, these definitions may not apply and may have little relationship to healthiness,' he says. 'In conversational English, the terms can be offensive and carry stigma. It’s therefore important for health professionals to use great sensitivity in discussions about a person’s weight and the relationship to their health.' Brock McLean, now much healthier, says he’d emphasise that self-worth doesn’t come from external factors, including physical appearance. 'Kids are taught to have high self-esteem if they’re particularly good at something … whereas self-worth teaches you the concept that no matter what you’re good at, no matter what you’re bad at, you’re a human being and you’re worthy of love and compassion.' Dr Willis and Dr Sturgiss urge anyone struggling with how they feel about their body or eating habits to seek support through their GP, and to ask where they can receive size-inclusive care.

423377700,"A 'baguette de tradition', or traditional baguette, is made from flour, water, salt and yeast. Period. Sounds simple, and on one level it is. Yet so much depends on the perfect baguette and the perfect baguette is elusive. A crunchy deep golden crust must encase a fluffy, slightly salty interior, punctuated with the small air sacs, known as alveoli, that produce a mildly chewy consistency. Appearance, taste, texture and smell must find a delicate harmony. French President Emmanuel Macron in Germany on Tuesday. This requires hard work. Selvarajah was a little irritated because his store assistants had not appeared. Always, he said, there’s some excuse. He works six days a week, up to 10 hours a day, and thinks such industry – typical of immigrants trying to get a toehold in a new land – may explain why several winners of the baguette prize over the past decade have been of Tunisian or Senegalese descent. The competition itself is anonymous. 'Baguettes are numbered after being deposited by candidates, then touched, smelled and tasted by a jury of experts,' Olivia Polski, the senior City Hall official who oversees the contest, said. The best baguette, she suggested, should be 'well-baked, light and airy. It should crackle in the mouth'. Baking is 'a tough profession,' said Charlotte Quemy, as she ate a croissant she described as 'top' outside Selvarajah’s bakery. She lives across town but likes to stop off on her way home from her job in the tech sector. 'The French view is: to hell with getting up at 3 in the morning!' Selvarajah arrived in France from Sri Lanka in 2006, and began work in an Italian restaurant making salads and desserts. Through a regular client at the restaurant, Xavier Maulavé, the owner of several bakeries, he was offered a job making bread. 'I knew nothing about baguettes,' Selvarajah said. Slowly, Selvarajah learnt the art, becoming the chief baker in 2012. In 2018, he participated in the baguette competition for the first time, coming in third. Business picked up. By 2021, with Maulavé pursuing other interests, he bought one of his stores. 'And now,' he beamed, 'the president of France is eating a Sri Lankan baker’s baguette every morning!' He loves his batons of bread. They are about 63 centimetres long. They weigh about 280 grams. The baguette’s optimum shelf life is no more than a few hours, often necessitating return visits to the boulangerie in a single day. So it is that, around this instantly recognisable stick of bread, French life still revolves. Of course there are other fine breads, and the rhythms of life have accelerated, as elsewhere. But some things do not change. Any unctuous sauce, say for a blanquette de veau or boeuf bourguignon, must be mopped off the plate with a chunk of baguette. Not to do so would be sacrilege. No oozing Camembert or delectable cured ham can go unaccompanied by a baguette. No breakfast at a cafe counter is complete without a 'tartine beurrée' – the divine butter of France thickly spread on strips of baguette. The fruit and tannin of a good Burgundy linger in the mouth as a baguette is chewed, finding in its texture at once crunchy and pillowy, and its mild saltiness, the perfect cradle. Selvarajah came to Paris, where a cousin and brother already lived because he could not find work in Sri Lanka. He has taken a small apartment five minutes from the bakery so that he can keep the gruelling hours of early-morning and late-afternoon shifts, while his wife and young children live in a larger apartment across town. 'I had no choice,' he said. 'I see them when I can.' He makes two or three pilgrimages a year to Chennai in India, where he meets Sri Amma Bhagavan, a contested cult leader whose religious movement, initially called Oneness, inspires him. 'Everyone is so tense today and thinking about money in a selfish way,' he said. 'He helps me to be happy inside my heart.' Still, in his line of work, some tension is unavoidable. Selvarajah smokes. 'Too much stress,' he said. He has a cough. 'It’s from the flour, 100 kilos of it every day.' He is restless. 'You have to prove yourself every day.' The baker’s Sri Lankan wife, whom he married in France, has become a French citizen, and both his children are also French. Will he follow suit? 'Maybe one day,' he said, 'but right now I don’t have time'. His 10-year residence permit is enough. Selvarajah is, however, not altogether happy over what the prize has meant for him. He has not been invited to meet Macron, who had a selfie taken with some previous winners. He feels he has gotten less French media attention than others in the past. Nor was he invited to a party this month organised by the confederation of French bakers marking the anniversary of the creation of the 'traditional baguette', defined with great detail in the 1993 Décret Pain, or Bread Decree, a quintessentially French edict laying out the procedure and characteristics required to be deemed 'traditional'. The baker attributes these perceived slights to the fact he is the first winner who is not from France or a country with a colonial connection to it. He also believes his decision not to become a French citizen is resented. 'It’s not pleasant, but I don’t give a damn,' he said. He thought for a moment. 'I’m thinking about expanding the franchise in Dubai and Sri Lanka, promoting French baguettes made by a Sri Lankan. There are big possibilities.' Asked if the Élysée had paid him for all the baguettes delivered, he said with a shrug: 'Not yet. Maybe at the end of the month.'

423372004,"Miriam interrumpió su trayectoria en HOY en 2007 para dedicarse a la comunicación institucional. Realizó labores de comunicación en la Consejería de Agricultura de la Junta de Extremadura y posteriormente trabajó en distintos proyectos de la Diputación de Badajoz. Esta tarea la llevó en 2012 varios meses a Ecuador donde participó en el diseño de un plan de comunicación de buenas prácticas para los municipios de este país. Viajó como cooperante con el Fondo Extremeño Local de Cooperación al Desarrollo. En 2014 se incorporó a la directiva de la Asociación de la Prensa de Badajoz como secretaria en una candidatura encabezada por Antonio Tinoco. Entre otros proyectos impulsó la creación del premio Sátira del Carnaval que otorgan los periodistas de Badajoz a las murgas que le cantan a la actualidad. Fue jurado del concurso de murgas en dos ocasiones y también jurado del certamen 'Badajoz, capital del desayuno'. En julio 2016 publicó un mensaje en sus redes sociales en el que indicaba que «volvía a casa». Se refería a volver a trabajar a la redacción de HOY donde continuó con su incansable labor en busca de historias. Su aportación a la hemeroteca de HOY es un ejemplo de Periodismo riguroso, comprometido y con una enorme dosis de empatía. Lo demostró, por ejemplo, en uno de los reportajes que más recordaba, la historia de Dani, un niño al que le falta parte de su mano y que recibió una prótesis inspirada en su superhéroe favorito, Ironman. En 2018 llegó conmocionada a la redacción después de entrevistar a Sonja Vrscaj, una superviviente de Auschwitz . Contó su historia y quedó marcada por su valentía. Las víctimas de la Guerra Civil española también encontraron visibilidad en la pluma de Miriam. Contó muchas historias que llevaban décadas esperando salir. Una de ellas fue la de Francisco Rodríguez, el 'Hombrecino de Almendral, que guardó durante más de 30 años en su cartera un folio con los nombres de los amigos que las tropas franquistas asesinaron al inicio de la contienda. Su sensibilidad le permitía transmitir el dolor de otros o las historias de superación con una mirada limpia, como si el lector se sentase junto al protagonista. Fue el caso de Inma Franco, una joven que sufría importantes secuelas en su rostro por las operaciones de niña, y que dio una lección de valentía reivindicando su belleza interior y exterior. Esta historia tuvo una gran repercusión, especialmente entre los adolescentes. Contó en ella con la colaboración de Marta Muñoz, reportera audiovisual de HOY, que fue su compañera de reportajes durante años. Ambas, por ejemplo, reivindicaron una de las joyas de Badajoz en la serie 'Guadiana, el río que nos une' que contó decenas de anécdotas. Con su habitual olfato desveló incluso los secretos de Manuel Hernández Carrasco 'Marifé', un personaje muy conocido que dejó la bebida gracias a sus paseos por la orilla. Y no solo en febrero, todos los meses del año, pensaba en su Carnaval, de hecho promovió la publicación de las guías de HOY y era muy querida y respetada por los carnavaleros. Contó historias de letras de las murgas, de costuras de las comparsas y del ambiente de la calle en el que se mezclaba, siempre con un disfraz original. El año que no se celebró la fiesta por la pandemia impulsó un especial en el periódico para conmemorar los 40 años.

423371506,"A novel biomaterial developed at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) in Brazil can help solve two problems at once. As a bioparticle, it can act as a drug carrier, delivering medication directly to the gastrointestinal tract of fish in order to circumvent resistance to conventional antibiotics, for example. In addition, it is administered orally in powder form and is highly palatable to fish, increasing the probability of effective treatment while at the same time reducing the waste and pollution inherent in the medication of these animals. in the journal Biomaterials Advances. 'Our bioparticle can pass through the digestive tract and deliver medication directly to the intestine , enhancing the efficacy of conventional drugs, which is increasingly impaired by bacterial resistance,' said Patrick D. Mathews, a co-author of the article. The research was conducted while he was a postdoctoral fellow at UNIFESP's Medical School (EPM). 'The material can be administered directly in the water, where it is consumed by the fish. The normal delivery method entails mixing medication into feed, so you never know how much is actually consumed as opposed to just polluting the water. This has become a serious issue for large fish farming ventures such as Chile's salmon industry,' said Mathews. The bioparticle is based on chitosan and alginate, polysaccharides of natural origin used in industry and research. Chitosan is derived from the shells of crustaceans, and alginate is derived from seaweed. The formulation also contains arginine, an amino acid present in most protein-rich foods. The antimicrobial molecule used was a peptide obtained from an arachnid found in Brazil's Southeast region. Specimens of Schwartz's catfish (Corydoras schwartzi), an ornamental fish species native to the Amazon and other parts of South America, were treated with the biomaterial for eight days. Analysis of their intestinal tissue showed high penetration of the biomaterial into epithelial cells and deeper layers of the organ. Various histological methods failed to detect any cytotoxic effects or other damage due to the particle. Hematological tests confirmed the absence of toxicity in blood cells. 'We used materials known to have little or no cytotoxicity. Chitosan also has the advantage of adhering well to mucous membranes , as demonstrated in the study. The tests also showed that it tolerates digestive tract acidity and reaches the intestine intact,' said Omar Mertins, a professor in EPM-UNIFESP's Biophysics Department and last author of the article. The material resulted from two projects led by Mertins: Parasites. In a previous study , the researchers tested the efficacy of a similar formulation against parasites that infect the same fish species. The bioparticle delivered the anthelmintic drug praziquantel, widely used to treat diseases caused by parasitic flatworms (helminths). 'These and other ornamental fish are mainly exported to Asia, Europe and the United States, taking large number of parasites with them. The introduction of novel pathogens via these exports is a significant risk for ecosystems and even commercial production, as they can contaminate both wild and farmed species,' Mathews said. In the intestines of the animals colonized by worms, the bioparticle penetrated the cysts built by the parasites for self-protection , demonstrating that the material can be used as a drug carrier to treat other fish species. An application has been filed for a patent on one of the formulations. The researchers will now test this and other formulations to treat parasites in fish commercially farmed for human consumption, such as the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and the Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). A study conducted in 2017 by another group of researchers estimated the annual loss to freshwater fish farming in Brazil due to disease at USD 84 million. 'The fact that the material is non-toxic to fish shows it isn't harmful for humans who consume their flesh. The prospects for application are highly positive,' Mertins said.",9578,novel biomaterial develop federal university são paulo unifesp brazil help solve problem bioparticle act drug carrier deliver medication directly gastrointestinal tract fish order circumvent resistance conventional antibiotic example addition administer orally powder form highly palatable fish increase probability effective treatment time reduce waste pollution inherent medication animal journal biomaterials advances bioparticle pass digestive tract deliver medication directly intestine enhance efficacy conventional drug increasingly impair bacterial resistance say patrick mathews co author article research conduct postdoctoral fellow unifesp medical school epm material administer directly water consume fish normal delivery method entail mix medication feed know actually consume oppose pollute water issue large fish farming venture chile salmon industry say mathews bioparticle base chitosan alginate polysaccharide natural origin industry research chitosan derive shell crustacean alginate derive seaweed formulation contain arginine amino acid present protein rich food antimicrobial molecule peptide obtain arachnid find brazil southeast region specimens schwartz catfish corydoras schwartzi ornamental fish specie native amazon part south america treat biomaterial day analysis intestinal tissue show high penetration biomaterial epithelial cell deep layer organ histological method fail detect cytotoxic effect damage particle hematological test confirm absence toxicity blood cell material know little cytotoxicity chitosan advantage adhere mucous membrane demonstrate study test show tolerate digestive tract acidity reach intestine intact say omar mertins professor epm unifesp biophysics department author article material result project lead mertin parasites previous study researcher test efficacy similar formulation parasite infect fish specie bioparticle deliver anthelmintic drug praziquantel widely treat disease cause parasitic flatworm helminth ornamental fish mainly export asia europe united states take large number parasite introduction novel pathogen export significant risk ecosystem commercial production contaminate wild farmed specie mathews say intestine animal colonize worm bioparticle penetrate cyst build parasite self protection demonstrate material drug carrier treat fish specie application file patent formulation researcher test formulation treat parasite fish commercially farm human consumption nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus tambaqui colossoma macropomum study conduct group researcher estimate annual loss freshwater fish farming brazil disease usd million fact material non toxic fish show harmful human consume flesh prospect application highly positive mertins say

Springsteen initially postponed his September dates while he recovered from symptoms related to peptic ulcer disease , which causes ulcers to form in the stomach or small intestine and can result in heartburn, nausea and stomach pain. According to the Mayo Clinic, peptic ulcers are 'open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper portion of your small intestine.' Springsteen never said exactly what symptoms he was fighting, only that he was 'heartbroken' to be sidelined for the next few months. 'Over here on E Street, we’re heartbroken to have to postpone these shows,' Springsteen said in a statement posted on his site and social-media platforms on Sept. 6.

423367775,"El manejo del ganado caprino en el entorno de los brezales es beneficioso en términos nutricionales y sanitarios y permite prolongar la estación de pastoreo. A. S. GONZÁLEZ. Dice el refrán que la cabra tira al monte. Alcanzado el cerro, lo ideal es que sus siguientes pasos le acerquen a los brezales, especialmente durante los meses de verano y otoño la época del destete. Un estudio del Serida, publicado en 2022, analiza los rendimientos e infecciones parasitarias de estos animales pastando en praderas de monte o matorrales tras dejar de mamar. La fase que comienza cuando las crías se separan del pecho de su madre es muy importante en el ciclo productivo ya que al inicio de otoño se incorporan los machos para la época de cubrición. Al parar la producción de leche, las necesidades energéticas se reducen pero la disponibilidad de pasto apetecible y su calidad también merma, lo que puede comprometer el estado corporal de las cabras y menguar sus tasas de reproducción. Los efectos de la composición botánica del pasto afecta a los rendimientos del ganado. Por un lado, por la vía nutricional y, por otro, por la del estado sanitario. Durante tres años, los técnicos del Serida analizaron la alimentación de las cabras en la finca de monte El Carbayal (Illano) y sus rendimientos, para averiguar si la baja calidad nutritiva de ciertos matorrales podría compensarse con un mejor estado sanitario de los animales para llegar a la época de cubrición con una adecuada condición corporal. Las cabras pastaron en vegetación, praderas, brezales y tojales tras el destete de sus crías. Las variaciones de peso y condición corporal del ganado caprino “son tan favorables en matorrales de brezal como en praderas mejoradas de raigrás y trébol, aunque peores en los tojales”. La infestación parasitaria gastrointestinal fue “significativamente menor” en los brezales gracias a los taninos, lo que compensa el menor valor nutritivo de la vegetación en comparación al pasto sembrado y también respecto al tojal, “dándose unos rendimientos aceptables en las cabras para su cubrición hacia el final de la estación de pastoreo y conseguir su éxito reproductivo”. Además de llegar en buen estado para la época de cubrición, las cabras podrían aguantar más tiempo pastando en los brezales y manteniendo unos rendimientos aceptables, gracias a sus menores tasas infectivas a esas alturas del otoño, alargando la estación de pastoreo antes de su estabulación al comienzo de la invernada, lo que además supondría un ahorro en costes de alimentación y de tratamientos sanitarios. Por todo ello, propone el Serida “el manejo post-destete de las cabras en los brezales, sin que se observen efectos negativos sobre las respuestas productivas de las cabras”. Esto permitiría un manejo más flexible en las zonas de monte donde abunden este tipo de matorrales, por ejemplo, reservando las praderas para los animales con requerimientos nutricionales y energéticos más exigentes. Aunque las cabras hacen un buen uso de los tojales en primavera, su utilización en verano-otoño tras el destete no sería aconsejable ya que les cuesta mucho mantenerse en buena condición en este tipo de matorrales espinosos, añaden los autores del trabajo, Rafael Celaya y Urcesino García Prieto, cuya recomendación final pasar por emplazar “las cabras en brezales con pequeñas zonas de prado o pradera.",9578,el manejo del ganado caprino en el entorno de los brezale es beneficioso en términos nutricionale y sanitario y permite prolongar la estación de pastoreo gonzález dice el refrán que la cabra tira al monte alcanzado el cerro lo ideal es que sus siguiente paso le acerquen los brezales especialmente durante los meses de verano y otoño la época del destete un estudio del serida publicado en analiza los rendimientos e infeccione parasitarias de estos animale pastando en praderas de monte o matorrale tras dejar de mamar la fase que comienza cuando las crías se separan del pecho de su madre es muy importante en el ciclo productivo ya que al inicio de otoño se incorporan los machos para la época de cubrición al parar la producción de leche las necesidades energéticas se reducen pero la disponibilidad de pasto apetecible y su calidad también merma lo que puede comprometer el estado corporal de las cabras y menguar sus tasas de reproducción los efecto de la composición botánica del pasto afecta los rendimientos del ganado por un lado por la vía nutricional y por otro por la del estado sanitario durante tre años los técnicos del serida analizaron la alimentación de las cabras en la finca de monte el carbayal illano y sus rendimientos para averiguar si la baja calidad nutritiva de ciertos matorrale podría compensarse con un mejor estado sanitario de los animales para llegar la época de cubrición con una adecuada condición corporal las cabras pastaron en vegetación pradera brezale y tojale tras el destete de sus cría las variacione de peso y condición corporal del ganado caprino son tan favorables en matorrale de brezal como en pradera mejorada de raigrás y trébol aunque peore en los tojales la infestación parasitaria gastrointestinal fue significativamente menor en los brezales gracias los taninos lo que compensa el menor valor nutritivo de la vegetación en comparación al pasto sembrado y también respecto al tojal dándose unos rendimientos aceptable en las cabras para su cubrición hacia el final de la estación de pastoreo y conseguir su éxito reproductivo además de llegar en buen estado para la época de cubrición las cabras podrían aguantar más tiempo pastando en los brezales y manteniendo uno rendimientos aceptable gracia sus menore tasa infectivas esas alturas del otoño alargando la estación de pastoreo antes de su estabulación al comienzo de la invernada lo que además supondría un ahorro en cost de alimentación y de tratamientos sanitario por todo ello propone el serida el manejo post destete de las cabras en los brezales sin que se observen efecto negativos sobre las respuestas productivas de las cabras esto permitiría un manejo más flexible en las zonas de monte donde abunden este tipo de matorrale por ejemplo reservando las praderas para los animales con requerimientos nutricionale y energéticos más exigente aunque las cabras hacen un buen uso de los tojales en primavera su utilización en verano otoño tras el destete sería aconsejable ya que les cuesta mucho mantenerse en buena condición en este tipo de matorrale espinosos añaden los autore del trabajo rafael celaya y urcesino garcía prieto cuya recomendación final pasar por emplazar las cabras en brezale con pequeñas zonas de prado o pradera
423368915,"La acumulación de mucosidad en el pecho y las flemas son dos síntomas particulares de la bronquitis aguda, una patología que ocasiona la hinchazón y la inflamación de las vías aéreas que llevan el aire hacia los pulmones. De acuerdo con Medline Plus, sitio web de la Biblioteca Nacional de Medicina de Estados Unidos, cuando se genera una hinchazón se genera un estrechamiento de las vía respiratorias, dificultado así la respiración. Cuando se habla de bronquitis aguda, se hace referencia a una infección prolongada que se caracteriza por emitir una tos con flema constante. Adicional a este síntoma, se relacionan otros que se deben tener en cuenta: Fiebre, usualmente baja. Dificultad respiratoria que empeora con la actividad. Sibilancias, en personas con asma. Ante estos síntomas, es fundamental acudir al médico para determinar la causa y el tratamiento a seguir. Asimismo, existen ciertos remedios caseros a base de aceites esenciales que se pueden realizar para aliviar los síntomas de la bronquitis aguda, pero su uso debe ser autorizado pro un profesional de la salud. Frente a esto, algunos aceites esenciales como de albahaca, corteza de canela, eucalipto, citronela, menta, romero, árbol de té, tomillo y orégano pueden ayudar a facilitar la reparación y aflojar rápidamente la mucosidad en el pecho. Un estudio científico denominado Aplicaciones farmacológicas, cosméticas y alimentarias, publicado en la revista Offarm y Elsevier, destaca que las propiedades antiinflamatorias del aceite de eucalipto, el cual estimulas las células del mucus y aumenta los movimientos de los cilios del árbol bronquial, ayuda a expectorar el pecho fácilmente. La forma más efectiva de utilizar el aceite de eucalipto es por vía tópica, pero también se puede utilizar por vía olfativas. A continuación, Medical News Today especifica como usarlo para eliminar la mucosidad del pecho: Vía tópica: se debe mezclar un cuarto de taza de aceite de coco con 12 gotas de aceite de eucalipto.

Żołędzie przede wszystkim: zawierają lekkostrawną skrobię i sporo błonnika, tak więc wspomagają pracę przewodu pokarmowego. są źródłem witamin i składników mineralnych - witamin z grupy B, kwasu foliowego, magnezu, potasu, miedzi, mangany, fosforu; znajdują się w nich wartościowe węglowodany złożone, a jednocześnie mają niewiele tłuszczów; pomagają wyregulować poziom cukru we krwi. Najpopularniejszym napojem jaki można przygotować z żołędzi jest kawa - pijano ją za czasów II wojny światowej, gdy brakowało najbardziej podstawowych produktów. Cenioną ją wówczas nie tylko za smak ale również z uwagi na fakt, że jest sycąca. Żołędziowa kawa pachnie i smakuje podobnie jak ta tradycyjna, jednak nie zawiera kofeiny - jest zatem bezpieczna dla tych osób, które z różnych względów po tradycyjną małą czarną nie mogą sięgać.

Elewację frontową i tylną, siedmioosiową, poprzedzają tarasy ograniczone ozdobnymi balustradami. Elewacje frontową, będącą jednocześnie elewacją ogrodową poprzedza duży taras, ograniczony dwustronnie biegnącą balustradą, nad którym na czterech kolumnach wspiera się w strefie piętra balkon. Elewacje obiega rytm prostokątnych okien ujętych w proste obramienia i profilowane listwy nadokienne. Dwie przybudówki parterowe flankowane na narożach wieżyczkami zwieńczonymi krenelażem. Pałac otacza park o charakterze krajobrazowym założony w końcu XIX wieku. W latach 14161427 wieś Połażejewo należała do braci Mikołaja i Świętosława Polojewskich, w latach późniejszych (15011510) własność Kapituły Gnieźnieńskiej. Do 1578 r. własność Stanisława Ossowskiego syna Pawła. Następnie wieś wchodziła w skład majątku Winna Góra nadanego gen. Henrykowi Dąbrowskiemu przez cesarza Napoleona. W początku XIX w. właścicielką była Bogumiła Bogusława Mańkowska urodzona w 1814 r. w Paryżu, córka Barbary Chłapowskiej i gen. Henryka Dąbrowskiego, oraz jej mąż gen. Teodor Mańkowski syn Seweryna, a wnuk Ignacego. We władaniu Mańkowskich dobra w Połażejewie były do 1854 r. Nowym nabywcą był książę Aleksander Czartoryski z Wiednia. Około roku 1868 właścicielem Połażejewa zostali Józef i Joanna Golscy. W 1872 roku nową właścicielką Połażejewa zostaje Maria von Rekowska, która wychodzi za mąż za Witolda Kosińskiego, syna powstańca styczniowego Władysława Kosińskiego z Targowej Górki, a wnuka Antoniego Amilkara Kosińskiego generała wojsk Księstwa Warszawskiego, walczącego u boku gen. Henryka Dąbrowskiego. Od roku 1883 właścicielem Połażejewa został Wacław Boening. Wkrótce dokonuje on pierwszych modyfikacji w istniejącym już zespole parkowo- dworskim. Początkowo nowe inwestycje dotyczą głównie parku i niektórych budynków inwentarskich. W 1918 nowym właściciel tego majątku, zostaje zapisany w księgach wieczystych jego młodszy brat Kazimierz. Kazimierz Boening był ostatnim właścicielem w okresie do drugiej wojny światowej. Pałac został przebudowany przynajmniej raz, w roku 1922 r. Majątek Połażejewo w okresie okupacji hitlerowskiej był pod zarządem niemieckim. Rodzina Kazimierza Boeninga musiała go opuścić. W pałacu pod koniec wojny zamieszkiwali niektórzy oficerowie niemieckiej Luftwaffe, którzy obsługiwali pobliskie lotnisko wojskowe w Mącznikach. Była to jednostka szkoleniowa. Po wojnie w roku 1945, w pałacu początkowo mieszkali znowu lotnicy, ale tym razem sowieccy. Był to okres wielkiej dewastacji tego obiektu., w roku 1946 Skarb Państwa, poprzez Państwowy Fundusz Ziemi, przejął majątek Połażejewo w tym zabudowania pałacowe z parkiem. Prawowitym właścicielom, wdowie pani Irenie Boening z córkami, pozwolono zamieszkać w pałacu na okres trzech miesięcy aby mogły spakować pozostałe jeszcze w pałacu ich rzeczy i następnie zostały wysiedlone do Krakowa. Potem zamieszkali w nim niektórzy parcelanci. Po przejęciu obiektu przez spółdzielnię, wykorzystywano go do różnych celów (głównie na mieszkania członków oraz biura) i wciąż ulegał on dalszej dewastacji, a przybudówka wschodnia, w której mieściła się pałacowa kuchnia uległa zawaleniu z powodu złego stanu technicznego. W roku 1950 parcelanci utworzyli Rolniczą Spółdzielnię Wytwórczą, później przemianowana na Produkcyjną. W 1988 r. RSP rozpoczęło remont pałacu, który z braku funduszy został przerwany. W roku 1998 istniejąca jeszcze RSP sprzedała pałac z parkiem państwu Jarosławowi i Karolinie Staszak z Wrześni, 17 lipca roku 2007, pałac odkupiła gdańska firma Archet Nausea spółka z o.o., której właścicielami są Dariusz Czerlonek i Iwona Wilczopolska-Czerlonek. W latach 20072011 pałacyk został odbudowany oraz została przeprowadzona rewitalizacja przypałacowego parku. Wszystkie prace były prowadzone pod nadzorem Wojewódzkiego Konserwatora Zabytków z Poznania.

423365055,"es una semilla que proviene de la planta de nombre científico Phalaris canariensis . Aunque es más comúnmente utilizada como alimento para pájaros, el alpiste también es consumido por humanos —en sus versiones aptas para su consumo— debido a sus numerosos beneficios para la salud, en el campo del bienestar óseo, muscular y gastrointestinal, además de la salud cardiovascular. El alpiste es rico en diversas propiedades nutricionales que promueven la salud del corazón y los vasos sanguíneos . Algunos de los beneficios más destacados se listan a continuación: Reducción del colesterol : contiene una enzima llamada lipasa , que es especialmente efectiva en la descomposición de las grasas y la reducción del colesterol en el cuerpo, consignó un estudio de la Universidad de Valladolid. Esto puede ayudar a prevenir enfermedades cardiovasculares como la aterosclerosis y la hipertensión Control de la presión arterial : el alpiste es rico en aminoácidos, que actúan como vasodilatadores, lo que significa que ayudan a dilatar los vasos sanguíneos y reducir la presión arterial. Esto es especialmente beneficioso para las personas que sufren de hipertensión Antioxidantes para un corazón sano : contiene una alta cantidad de antioxidantes, como los flavonoides y los polifenoles, que protegen las células del daño causado por los radicales libres. Esto puede prevenir el envejecimiento prematuro y reducir el riesgo de Regulación de la glucosa en sangre : la lipasa también puede ayudar a regular los niveles de glucosa en sangre.

423361254,"- Jest dużo więcej samych zakażeń paciorkowcowych, co widać po zgłoszeniach. Natomiast największy przyrost dotyczy właśnie zespołu wstrząsu toksycznego , czyli jednej z tych najcięższych postaci zakażenia paciorkowcami. To, co dla mnie jako anestezjologa było najbardziej zaskakujące, to przypadki ciężkie pacjentów, którzy z powodu zakażenia lądowali na OIOM-ie. Ta fala była nieporównywalna do czegokolwiek, co widzieliśmy wcześniej - podkreśla dr Górka. 2. Młodzi, nieobciążeni innymi schorzeniami, nagle trafiali na OIOM. Zespół lekarzy z 5 Wojskowego Szpitala Klinicznego w Krakowie opublikował pracę opisującą piorunujący przebieg tych inwazyjnych zakażeń. Dr Górka przyznaje, że przebieg choroby był zaskoczeniem dla samych lekarzy i przypominał początki pandemii COVID, kiedy do szpitali w ciężkim stanie trafiali młodzi, nieobciążeni schorzeniami pacjenci, których trudno było uratować. Śmiertelność w tych przypadkach była bardzo wysoka, ponad 80 proc. Opisaliśmy sześć przypadków, w pięciu - choroba zakończyła się zgonem, pomimo wszelkich starań, pomimo wykorzystania wszelkich możliwych sposobów leczenia. - Każdy z tych przypadków odcisnął na nas swoje piętno. W przypadku młodej pacjentki, którą udało nam się uratować, w wyniku inwazyjnej choroby paciorkowcowej wystąpiła ciężka niewydolność oddechowa. Pacjentka była na granicy stosowania technik pozaustrojowych, natomiast udało się wyleczyć ją bez ich wykorzystania. Wyszła z intensywnej terapii, ale wymaga jeszcze długotrwałej opieki medycznej, rehabilitacji. Ma problemy z martwicą dystalnych fragmentów kończyn górnych, kończyn dolnych, palców, paliczków, ale najważniejsze, że przeżyła, co jest dużym sukcesem, bo na pewnym etapie rokowania nie były najlepsze - zaznacza dr Górka. 3. Tych objawów nie wolno lekceważyć. Specjalista anestezjologii radzi, by przy objawach budzących podejrzenie zakażenia paciorkowcem wykonywać strep test , czyli wymaz z gardła, podobny, jak w przypadku testów na COVID. Tego typu testy są dostępne w placówkach POZ, można je też kupić w aptekach. W przypadku potwierdzenia infekcji paciorkowcowej kluczowe jest szybkie podanie antybiotyków. Jakie mogą być pierwsze symptomy inwazyjnego zakażenia paciorkowcami? Co powinno nas zaalarmować? - Dla tych inwazyjnych chorób paciorkowcowych charakterystyczne jest m.in. zajęcie skóry i tkanki podskórnej, więc jeżeli mamy do czynienia z wysoką i trudną do zbicia gorączką i zajęciem tkanki podskórnej, zaczerwienieniem, obrzękiem, nadmiernym uciepleniem skóry tułowia czy kończyn, to zawsze wymaga zgłoszenia do lekarza. Często w przypadku włączenia adekwatnej antybiotykoterapii na bardzo wczesnym etapie, udaje się tę chorobę kontrolować. Natomiast jeżeli pomimo włączenia antybiotyku stan pacjenta się nie poprawia w ciągu 48 godzin, to jest już alarmujące - wyjaśnia dr Górka. - To są chorzy, którzy powinni pilnie szukać pomocy w szpitalu, bo może u nich dochodzić do uogólnienia się infekcji. W przypadku pacjentów, których hospitalizowaliśmy, ten stan dość dramatycznie się pogarszał. Pomimo stosowania antybiotyków pojawiały się u nich zaburzenia świadomości, zaburzenia oddychania, ciśnienie tętnicze było mocno obniżone , skurczowe ciśnienie wynosiło poniżej 90 mmHg lub spadało o 30-40 mmHg poniżej normalnych dla pacjenta wartości - zaznacza lekarz. - To też jest apel do pacjentów - jeżeli zalecona im antybiotykoterapia nie przynosi efektu, powinni jak najszybciej zgłosić się do lekarza, nie czekając, aż będzie naprawdę źle - dodaje. 4. To nie koniec zakażeń paciorkowcami. Nadal nie jest jasne, co stoi za wzrostem aktywności paciorkowców, zwłaszcza że to zjawisko obserwowane w wielu krajach. Dr Górka wskazuje, że jest kilka teorii na ten temat. Mówi się m.in. o tym, że może to być wynik rozregulowania układu immunologicznego po pandemii COVID-19, kwestia zmian w obrębie szczepu lub zwiększonej oporności na antybiotyki. - Zdarza się, że te infekcje rozwijają się wskutek nadkażeń bakteryjnych po infekcjach wirusowych , czyli pacjent przechodzi jakąś infekcję wirusową, przeziębieniową czy grypę i później w wyniku nadkażenia bakteryjnego dochodzi do rozwoju inwazyjnego zakażenia paciorkowcowego - przypomina lekarz. - Najwięcej tych inwazyjnych zakażeń było w pierwszych miesiącach roku, także wydaje się, że fala spowolniła, natomiast cały czas te przypadki się zdarzają. Te paciorkowce są z nami, więc nasza czujność powinna być wzmożona. Po pewnej przerwie widzimy znowu zwiększoną liczbę zachorowań na COVID. Ten trend jest zgodny z tym, co dzieje się na całym świecie i prawdopodobnie kolejna fala zakażeń inwazyjnych paciorkowcowych również przed nami - podsumowuje dr Górka.

423358849,"Trotzdem musste im Sommer 2018 die brandenburgische Gesundheitsministerin Diana Golze (Linke) zurücktreten, obwohl sie von irgendwelchen möglicherweise kriminellen Machenschaften überhaupt keine Kenntnis hatte bis das ARD-Magazin Kontraste einen vermeintlichen Skandal aufdeckte . Ihr wurde jedoch vorgehalten, sie habe ihren Laden nicht im Griff. Ihr wurde auch angekreidet, nichts gegen die personelle Unterbesetzung der Medikamentenaufsicht im Landesgesundheitsamt unternommen zu haben. Die Aufsicht hatte auf Hinweise zu Unregelmäßigkeiten bei Lunapharm nicht sofort angemessen reagiert. Jetzt steht Gunter K. vor dem Landgericht Potsdam und mit ihm Susanne K., die Chefin von Lunapharm. Beide sind angeklagt wegen Handels mit gefälschten Medikamenten. Die Medikamente waren zwar echt, wurden aber teils illegal besorgt, so der Vorwurf. Allein die Hauptakten zu diesem Prozess umfassen rund 5000 Seiten. Susanne K. will sich erst beim nächsten Verhandlungstermin am 20. Oktober äußern. Doch nachdem der am Mittwochmorgen eröffnete Prozess nach anderthalb Stunden vertagt ist, verteilt ihre Verteidigerin Bettina Holstein vor dem Saal eine Pressemitteilung. Darin heißt es, die Beschuldigte werde sich am 20. Oktober ausführlich zu allen Anschuldigungen äußern und für Fragen zur Verfügung stehen. Schon jetzt ist aber zu betonen, dass niemand den Vorwurf erhoben hat, es seien mit denen von der Lunapharm Deutschland GmbH vertriebenen Medikamenten zu irgendeinem Zeitpunkt Probleme aufgetreten, steht in der Pressemitteilung. Irgendeine Täuschung oder gar Gefährdung von Patienten lag nie vor. Das hörte sich 2018 beim Magazin Kontraste noch anders an: Von Lunapharm vertriebene Krebsmedikamente seien in griechischen Krankenhäusern gestohlen und angeblich auf einem Fischmarkt in Athen zwischengelagert worden, bevor Kuriere diese in Koffern per Flugzeug nach Deutschland schafften. Die betreffenden Krebspräparate müssten aber bei zwei bis acht Grad Celsius aufbewahrt werden. Die Kühlkette könnte unterbrochen gewesen sein. Damit könnten die Mittel unwirksam geworden sein. Davon ist in den Auszügen, die zwei mit dem Fall betraute Staatsanwälte am Mittwoch aus der Anklageschrift vortragen, allerdings nicht die Rede. Auch hatten Nachprüfungen schon ergeben, dass die vorschriftsmäßig zurückgehaltenen Proben von den einzelnen Chargen allesamt einwandfrei waren. Das bietet zwar keine 100-prozentige Sicherheit. Es lässt aber darauf schließen, dass keine unwirksamen Medikamente verabreicht worden sind. Illegal waren die Geschäfte der Anklage zufolge aber doch, weil die Apotheke in Griechenland keine Erlaubnis für den Großhandel hatte. Von dort weiter Medikamente zu beziehen, untersagte das Landesgesundheitsamt deshalb im Jahr 2017. Aber die Lunapharm-Chefin soll einfach weitergemacht und die tatsächliche Herkunft der Lieferungen dann nur verschleiert haben . Ein Pharmagroßhändler aus Zypern soll die Rechnungen geschrieben haben, als ob er der Lieferant sei. Gezahlt habe Lunapharm aber nicht an ihn, sondern soll die geforderten Summen an Rheingold Pharma überwiesen haben Firmen von Mohamed H., für die er seinen Rechtsanwalt Gunter K. als Geschäftsführer eingesetzt habe. Von den Rheingold-Konten sei das Geld bar abgehoben worden. Insgesamt sollen es 853 785 Euro gewesen sein. 23 derartige Fälle werden Susanne K. und Gunter K. zur Last gelegt, drei weitere Fälle allein dem 66-jährigen Anwalt. Ein Staatsanwalt und eine Staatsanwältin verlesen vor Gericht einen Fall nach dem anderen. Sie nennen dabei den Umfang der Lieferungen: fünf Packungen, acht Packungen oder mehrere Hundert mit 3,5 bis 500 Milligramm von dieser oder jener Substanz, darunter das Narkosemittel Avertin und das in der Brustkrebstherapie verwendete Mittel Herceptin. Die Staatsanwältin zitiert aus den einzelnen Posten zum Beispiel ein kleiner Posten aus dem Jahr 2017, wo Lunapharm mit einer Lieferung, die an vier verschiedene Abnehmer weiterveräußert wurde, einen Reingewinn von 4110,69 Euro gemacht haben soll. Insgesamt soll das Unternehmen von Susanne K. mit solchen Deals Einnahmen in Höhe von rund 1,1 Millionen Euro erzielt haben. Es sei dann auch noch per Darlehen Geld von der Lunapharm Limited, deren Direktorin Susanne K. gewesen ist, zur Lunapharm Deutschland GmbH geschoben worden, als deren Geschäftsführerin die 59-Jährige nach wie vor firmiert. Auch von einer Gewinnausschüttung von 500 000 Euro an sie persönlich und ihren Mann ist die Rede. Nach Abzug von Steuern und Solizuschlag seien für sie dabei 368 000 Euro übrig geblieben. Susanne K. lässt die Verlesung der Anklagepunkte, bei der ein Staatsanwalt zu haspeln beginnt und von der Richterin gebeten wird, doch etwas langsamer vorzutragen, gefasst über sich ergehen. Ihr Mann ist mit im Verhandlungssaal Nummer 6 und hat einen eigenen Rechtsbeistand an seiner Seite. Gunter K. erzählt im Anschluss sogar beinahe fröhlich aus seinem Leben: Dass er in einem Dorf nördlich von Frankfurt am Main aufgewachsen ist, mit seiner 2005 verstorbenen ersten Frau zwei erwachsene Söhne hat, von denen einer ebenfalls Anwalt wurde und der andere Archäologe, und seine zweite Frau noch vier Kinder in die Ehe brachte, die ebenfalls erwachsen sind. Das Paar wohnt in Limburg in einem 730 Jahre alten Haus. Von dort pendelt Gunter K. in seine Kanzlei in Wiesbaden, die er langsam auslaufen lassen möchte. Vier Tage in der Woche hat er dort noch zu tun. Seit einem Jahr beziehe er 1700 Euro Rente. Die Kanzlei werfe jetzt noch durchschnittlich etwas unter 2000 Euro im Monat ab. Seine Mandanten hätten Vertrauen zu ihm und wollten sich nicht an jemanden anderen gewöhnen. Deshalb sei es schwierig, die Kanzlei an einen jüngeren Nachfolger zu übergeben. Auch der Mitangeklagte Mohamed H. sei so ein Fall gewesen. Der ist jetzt übrigens so gut wie raus aus der Sache. Ein Gutachten von zwei Amtsärztinnen aus Offenbach bescheinigt dem 1949 geborenen Angeklagten Kurzatmigkeit schon nach wenigen Schritten und andere Leiden. Mit dem Rollator sei er mit Tochter und Enkel in die Sprechstunde gekommen. Er sei reise- und verhandlungsunfähig. Das Gericht trennt das Verfahren gegen ihn ab. Vermutlich wird es nicht wieder aufgenommen. Es scheint unwahrscheinlich, dass sich der Gesundheitszustand des pflegebedürftigen Beschuldigten in Zukunft so verbessert, dass er vor Gericht erscheinen könnte. Er kann nicht einmal mehr aus eigener Kraft stehen, so der Befund der Amtsärztinnen aus Offenbach.",9578,trotzdem musste m sommer die brandenburgische gesundheitsministerin diana golze linke

Ein Gutachten hat ergeben, dass ein Blutfleck an Chrupallas damaliger Kleidung mit einer Einstichverletzung korrespondiert. Das teilte die Staatsanwaltschaft Ingolstadt mit, die in dem Fall die Ermittlungen leitet. Nach SPIEGEL-Informationen handelte es sich um rötlich-braune Flecken an T-Shirt und Hemd, die durch DNA-Analysa eindeutig Chrupalla zugeordnet werden konnten. Unklar ist demnach weiterhin, wie es zu der Verletzung kam und wer dafür möglicherweise verantwortlich ist. Man konzentriere sich nun weiterhin auf die Frage, »wann und auf welche Weise« die Einstichverletzung entstanden sei und wer diese verursacht habe. Dazu würden weiter unter anderem Zeugen identifiziert und Videos gesichtet, hieß es von der Staatsanwaltschaft. Bislang gebe es keinen Anfangsverdacht gegen konkrete Personen, die Chrupalla hatte vor einem geplanten Wahlkampfauftritt am vergangenen Mittwoch in Ingolstadt Selfies gemacht; dabei kam er mit mehreren Personen in Kontakt. Nach eigenen Angaben bemerkte er zunächst nichts, nach ein paar Minuten jedoch habe er einen Schmerz sowie Übelkeit, Krämpfe und Schwindel verspürt. Der Politiker wurde daraufhin medizinisch erstversorgt und anschließend in die Klinik gebracht, die er tags darauf wieder verließ. Ein toxikologisches Gutachten hatte Wie der SPIEGEL aus Ermittlerkreisen erfuhr, liegen inzwischen auch die vorläufigen Ergebnisse von zwei kriminaltechnischen Untersuchungen zweier Pinnadeln vor, die in der Nähe des Veranstaltungsgeländes gefunden worden waren. Demnach konnte an den Nadeln keine DNA Chrupallas entdeckt werden. Das endgültige textilkundliche Gutachten zu Chrupallas Kleidung steht noch aus. Bei einer Pressekonferenz am Vormittag äußerte sich Chrupalla zu dem Fall. »Insgesamt ist dieser Angriff auf mich als Anschlag zu werten«, sagte er. Er habe sich am Freitag nach dem Vorfall im Städtischen Klinikum Dresden »den gesamten Einstich« am Oberarm entfernen lassen und pathologisch untersuchen lassen. Bei der Pressekonferenz ging Chrupalla auch die Staatsanwaltschaft an; er kritisierte, dass gesundheitsbezogene Informationen herausgegeben und die Presse einseitig informiert worden sei. Er forderte, jede weitere »rechtswidrige amtliche Äußerung unverzüglich zu unterlassen«. In ihrer Pressemitteilung wehren sich die Ermittler gegen den Vorwurf. Dass man die Presse informiert habe, »war aufgrund des hohen öffentlichen Interesses durch den Verdacht eines Angriffs auf einen Politiker während einer Wahlkampfveranstaltung veranlasst«, so die Behörde. Dabei habe man sich im Rahmen der gesetzlichen Vorgaben bewegt. Zudem heben die Ermittler darauf ab, dass die AfD selbst den Vorfall in die Öffentlichkeit trug und von einem »tätlichen Angriff« sprach: »Zu berücksichtigen ist in diesem Zusammenhang natürlich, dass wesentliche Informationen zum Gesundheitszustand der Presse bereits bekannt waren.«",9578,zum fall der abgebrochenen wahlkampfveranstaltung von afd chef tino chrupalla vergangene woche gibt es neue erkenntnisse ein gutachten hat ergeben dass ein blutfleck chrupallas damaliger kleidung mit einer einstichverletzung korrespondiert das teilte die staatsanwaltschaft ingolstadt mit die dem fall die ermittlungen leitet nach spiegel informationen handelte es sich um rötlich braune flecken t shirt und hemd die durch dna analysa eindeutig chrupalla zugeordnet werden konnten unklar ist demnach weiterhin wie es zu der verletzung kam und wer dafür möglicherweise verantwortlich ist man konzentriere sich nun weiterhin auf die frage wann und auf welche weise die einstichverletzung entstanden sei und wer diese verursacht habe dazu würden weiter unter anderem zeugen identifiziert und videos gesichtet hieß es von der staatsanwaltschaft bislang gebe es keinen anfangsverdacht gegen konkrete personen die chrupalla hatte vor einem geplanten wahlkampfauftritt vergangenen mittwoch ingolstadt selfies gemacht dabei kam er mit mehreren personen kontakt nach eigenen angaben bemerkte er zunächst nicht nach ein paar minuten jedoch habe er einen schmerz sowie übelkeit krämpfe und schwindel verspürt der politiker wurde daraufhin medizinisch erstversorgt und anschließend die klinik gebracht die er tag darauf wieder verließ ein toxikologische gutachten hatte wie der spiegel aus ermittlerkreisen erfuhr liegen inzwischen auch die vorläufigen ergebnisse von zwei kriminaltechnischen untersuchungen zweier pinnadeln vor die der nähe des veranstaltungsgeländes gefunden worden waren demnach konnte den nadeln keine dna chrupallas entdeckt werden das endgültige textilkundliche gutachten zu chrupallas kleidung steht noch aus bei einer pressekonferenz vormittag äußerte sich chrupalla zu dem fall insgesamt ist dieser angriff auf mich als anschlag zu werten sagte er er habe sich freitag nach dem vorfall m städtischen klinikum dresden den gesamten einstich oberarm entfernen lassen und pathologisch untersuchen lassen bei der pressekonferenz ge chrupalla auch die staatsanwaltschaft er kritisierte dass gesundheitsbezogene informationen herausgegeben und die presse einseitig informiert worden sei er forderte jede weitere rechtswidrige amtliche äußerung unverzüglich zu unterlassen ihrer pressemitteilung wehren sich die ermittler gegen den vorwurf dass man die presse informiert habe war aufgrund des hohen öffentlichen interesses durch den verdacht eine angriffs auf einen politiker während einer wahlkampfveranstaltung veranlasst die behörde dabei habe man sich m rahmen der gesetzlichen vorgaben bewegt zudem heben die ermittler darauf ab dass die afd selbst den vorfall die öffentlichkeit trug und von einem tätlichen angriff sprach zu berücksichtigen ist diesem zusammenhang natürlich dass wesentliche informationen zum gesundheitszustand der presse bereit bekannt waren

423352734,"Brock McLean says it was 'almost destiny' that he would aspire to play in the Australian Football League , following in the footsteps of several family members. 'I was very much an all-or-nothing person – everything I did was absolutely flat out,' he says. McLean’s AFL career lasted over a decade. From the beginning, he loved pushing his body to the limit, training up to 20 times a week. After several injuries, he went on a strict diet 'just to lose a few kilos' in a bid to reduce injury risk. 'And it helped: my performance was really good. It reinforced to me that that was the right thing.' Gradually, McLean became obsessed with food: weighing every item, and weighing himself before and after he ate. He believed this focus was giving him an edge as a footballer. 'Everything was tied up in that … without football, I felt completely worthless.' Then a coach asked him to lose more weight to improve his leg speed, which his nutritionist warned against. But, worried over time lost to injuries, McLean wanted to do everything to ensure he could play. He deprived himself of certain foods, entering a cycle of binge-eating, suffering terrible guilt, and frequently making himself vomit. 'I’d panic if I jumped on the scales and was [a certain weight], I’d think ‘oh God, I’m putting on weight, I’m not going to play’ … I was dealing with depression, and it was around then that suicidal ideation became a problem.' He attempted suicide on 23 August 2017. 'I’m very lucky that I was found when I was, by my partner … I realised I needed to keep seeing a psychologist and keep working on my issues.' Helen Bird, education services manager at the Butterfly foundation, an eating disorder charity, says there’s growing recognition of the prevalence of disordered eating in sports – which can affect players at any level – and an increasing number of sports groups are approaching them for support. The AFL and AFLW dropped skinfold testing, which involves using calipers to measure the thickness of skin and underlying fat at specific places on the body, for draft prospects in 2021 . Now experts are questioning the usefulness of measures such as weight and body composition as indicators of athletic performance – and health more broadly. The Compeat Performance team, which provides nutrition support to the Matildas, stopped weighing players two years ago – saying it came at the cost of player performance, and didn’t have a clear purpose. Photograph: Darren England/AAP. In 2022, the authors of a small study of 22 AFLW players called for practitioners to prioritise factors such as aerobic fitness and muscular power, after finding no significant relationship between pre-season body composition measures and match performance. The Compeat Performance team, which provides nutrition support to the Matildas, stopped weighing players or monitoring body composition two years ago – saying the metrics often came at the cost of player performance, and didn’t have a clear purpose. There remains a widespread emphasis on weight and performance in many areas of sport, Compeat co-CEO Alicia Edge says. 'When we’re looking at the research, the only real connection we’ve got is that there’s a relationship between lean mass and our ability to perform, but no clear connection when we’re looking at body fat,' says Edge, an advanced sports dietitian. 'So if we’re looking at that cultural [idea] of always aiming for ‘lighter is better’, we’re basing that on our own assumptions rather than what the research is telling us.' Edge and Compeat co-CEO Dan Edge began questioning the role of these measures back in 2016. 'We started to fully appreciate that whenever we’re working with weight or body composition, that’s a lag measure, it’s a symptom. If the problem is perceived to be body fat, or whatever it may be, ‘eat less or train more’ is a really over-simplified solution that doesn’t appreciate the person behind the data.' Weight and body composition can still be discussed, Edge says. But they have developed a new screening tool to track progress without those metrics, which also helps them understand clients’ relationships with food and other influences on their health behaviours. 'When we’re getting to know someone, we’re considering all those influences … mental, social, financial, and physical wellbeing – along with their occupation, culture, and environment.' Focusing on controlling something uncontrollable can fuel anxiety, she adds, because body weight and composition aren’t predictable outcomes. Prof Amanda Salis of the University of Western Australia says: 'Body size is influenced by a combination of dozens, if not hundreds of things.' 'You’ve got major players like genetics, and the environment – the food, physical activity, the stress environment … We also have our past and emotions – if someone goes through adverse childhood experiences, that plays out in how much they eat, move, and their stress, and all have an impact on the size we exist in.' She says that while many assume size comes down to 'personal choice and willpower', in reality 'it’s much more complex than it’s often made out to be'. Salis has authored several books on weight management and is now running a clinical weight loss trial using total meal replacement products, an approach she stresses should not be adopted without medical supervision. BMI – a calculation with roots in the development of eugenics – is only relevant at a population level. Salis says it won’t provide information on someone’s metabolic health, which should be the priority. 'Even someone who might have a very high BMI, a doctor might see no, they haven’t got the risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, etc. when looking at their blood sugar or glucose levels for example. 'There’s some good evidence that a waist circumference above a certain number is likely to be associated with metabolic diseases, compared to having a waist below a certain number, and it’s different according to age and sex and things, but it’s not an absolute indicator, nor is BMI … it’s all just probabilistic.' The recent National Eating Disorders Strategy flags weight stigma as a risk to physical and mental health. However, experts have pointed to a disconnect between the research and ‘weight-centric’ resources available online (including from the federal government ), many of which still include BMI calculators. Feeling judged for any reason, including body size, can lead people to avoid seeking healthcare, says Canberra-based GP Dr Liz Sturgiss. I like to focus on, ‘what’s life like at the moment?’ … not just the numbers 'We know women with larger bodies have lower rates of cervical screening, they have fewer presentations for breast screening. All these things mean that if you have a bigger body, you’ll have poorer health outcomes than someone in a smaller body,' says Sturgiss, who is also a primary care researcher at Monash University. Advanced dietitian Dr Fiona Willer adds that weight stigma may also lead people to celebrate any weight loss, whereas the underlying causes may be sinister. 'The overlap between people who are intentionally losing weight and unintentionally losing weight can be quite significant. Somebody can be suffering from a form of cancer and losing weight because of that, but because they’re also trying to diet at the same time, they don’t realise it’s not the diet, it’s that they’re actually dying and no one’s picked it up yet.' Sturgiss’ echoes that making assumptions about health based on body size comes with risks for any patient, and she warns against 'cheering the scales'. Many of her patients are from low-income groups and have food insecurity, so weight loss may prompt concerns of malnutrition. Usually the most relevant thing about somebody’s high body weight is how they’ve been treated because of it 'If someone is binging on laxatives, exercising in unhelpful ways, they have no money for food – none of those things are good,' Sturgiss says. She only weighs patients if they are happy to be weighed, as one of several measures – with the focus on any changes over time, and understanding the driving forces. 'I like to focus on, ‘what’s life like at the moment?’ … not just the numbers.' 'There are plenty of people who have very low body weights and really poor cardiovascular outcomes for all kinds of reasons. So any time we put out health messaging, either in an individual consultation or in public health messaging, that if your body’s not large you’re fine … that’s really unhelpful.' If a patient has ‘adiposity’ or body fat causing health issues – the WHO definition for obesity or overweight that Sturgiss uses – and wants to address that, she says they should be supported. 'But we live in a society incredibly biased against people who have larger bodies … and you don’t want to be supporting any kind of industry that involves body shaming, so it’s a difficult line to walk.' Willer, who runs a business training health professionals in size-inclusive approaches, says people with bigger bodies often anticipate their health professional will raise the topic of weight, and fear healthcare will be ‘gate-kept’ due to their size. ‘No matter what you’re good at, no matter what you’re bad at, you’re a human being and you’re worthy of love and compassion,’ says Brock McLean, much healthier now, pictured with his wife, Stephanie. Photograph: Brock McLean. 'Size inclusive practice understands that weight is not nothing – but usually the most relevant thing about somebody’s high body weight is how they’ve been treated because of it. 'Size inclusive practice supports someone in the body they have, at that time, and looks for treatments for whatever their presenting complaint is that don’t require starvation or weight change prior to addressing the health condition they’ve presented with.' Dr Mark Morgan, chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners quality care expert committee, is overseeing the new edition of the Red Book, which will include updated guidelines for GPs on screening for weight-related health issues. He echoes that it’s crucial everyone feels respected when attending general practice, noting the words ‘overweight’ and ‘obesity’ have specific definitions in a medical context so clinicians, researchers and epidemiologists can use a common language. But, 'for individuals, these definitions may not apply and may have little relationship to healthiness,' he says. 'In conversational English, the terms can be offensive and carry stigma. It’s therefore important for health professionals to use great sensitivity in discussions about a person’s weight and the relationship to their health.' Brock McLean, now much healthier, says he’d emphasise that self-worth doesn’t come from external factors, including physical appearance. 'Kids are taught to have high self-esteem if they’re particularly good at something … whereas self-worth teaches you the concept that no matter what you’re good at, no matter what you’re bad at, you’re a human being and you’re worthy of love and compassion.' Dr Willis and Dr Sturgiss urge anyone struggling with how they feel about their body or eating habits to seek support through their GP, and to ask where they can receive size-inclusive care.

423352835,"y, solo en España, más del 50% es intolerante a algún alimento . Pero, ¿Qué diferencia hay entre estas dos? Aunque a priori pueden ser muy parecidas en cuanto a síntomas, la verdad es que nuestro cuerpo las produce por cuestiones bien diferentes . Por ello y para una mayor prevención, hay que atender a lo que dicen los expertos. Bajo las directrices médicas siempre hay una ruta que conduce a mejorar la calidad de vida de los pacientes. Diferencias entre alergia e intolerancia. Para dictaminar la diferencia que hay entre una alergia y una intolerancia hay que saber qué es lo que se produce en nuestro cuerpo para padecerlas. La AESAN (Agencia Española de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición) sitúa que del 1 al 3% de adultos y del 4 al 6% de niños sufren consecuencias adversas por el consumo de alimentos . Las respuestas hipersensibles que se producen se pueden manifestar, por tanto, de diferentes formas.  La alergia se produce cuando el organismo detecta un alérgeno , es decir, una sustancia amenazante para nuestro cuerpo. Por tanto, entra en escena una respuesta inflamatoria por la producción de anticuerpos IgE . Son estos los que provocan síntomas como irritaciones, enrojecimiento de ojos, erupciones, problemas respiratorios y en los casos de más gravedad, un shock anafiláctico que puede ser mortal. No obstante, la intolerancia ocurre cuando nuestro organismo no ha podido digerir bien un compuesto de alimentos . Esto desencadena en nuestro cuerpo una sintomatología que no es tan peligrosa o grave como la de las alergias. Así pues, puedes notar distensión abdominal, inflamación, náuseas, vómitos, retortijones o diarrea. Por tanto, la gran diferencia entre ambas, según relatan los expertos del Hospital Universitario La Moraleja, es que En los últimos años, el crecimiento de alergias e intolerancias en las personas es evidente. Los alimentos muy procesados, así como los que provienen de fuera de nuestras fronteras, hacen que nuestro cuerpo tenga que habituarse a ingredientes antes desconocidos. Existe una gran variedad de alergias e intolerancias , pero según remarcan los expertos hay algunas que copan más las consultas. ¿Quieres saber cuáles son? Alergia a lácteos, pescados y legumbres. Estos alimentos son los que más alergias producen entre la población seguida del huevo y los frutos secos. Los expertos hablan del cacahuete como el que más reacciones alérgicas producen en las personas. ​Intolerancia a la lactosa. En cuanto a las intolerancias, la lactosa se lleva el principal papel. Cabe destacar que aquí entra en juego saber diferenciar muy bien si lo que hay es una alergia a la proteína de la leche o una intolerancia en sí. Para ello se debe poner especial atención con los profesionales médicos a la sintomatología antes descrita y diferenciada. Posibles causas y cómo saber detectarlas. ¿Por qué soy alérgico o por qué tengo esta intolerancia? Son muchos los pacientes que se pueden llegar a hacer esta pregunta. Como en muchas otras cuestiones de salud, los factores del entorno o de nuestro cuerpo juegan un papel esencial. Según Hegoi Segurola, nutricionista del Hospital Universitario Vall d’Hebron la genética podría tener mucho que ver. En el caso de las intolerancias, también puede haber un componente hereditario. Pero, más concretamente, hay que poner especial atención a nuestro sistema digestivo. Un desajuste de la microbiota intestinal que esté afectando a la permeabilidad del intestino podría ser un catalizador de estos problemas. Es primordial, según cuentan los profesionales sanitarios, que la barrera intestinal esté sana para una correcta absorción de los nutrientes. Así pues, si padeces algunos de los síntomas anteriormente descritos o tienes sospechas de padecer alguna intolerancia, lo mejor es acudir a tu médico. Actualmente, existen diversas pruebas que te ayudarán a encontrar un diagnóstico y mejorar tu calidad de vida. Referencias. AESAN - Agencia Española de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutrición .

423352979,"Toen Sarah eerst begon te hoesten deden haar ouders dit af als astma-symptomen. Maar ondanks het gebruik van haar normale medicatie werd het niet minder. Sarah kon nog amper ademhalen. “Haar hoest was heel anders dan normaal,” vertelde Sarahs moeder Mary aan de Britse media, “Ze belde me op die ochtend toen ik mijn andere kinderen naar school bracht en zei ’Kom terug mama, ik voel me niet goed ik ben bang!’” Sarahs vader bracht haar met spoed naar het ziekenhuis en de dokters kwamen erachter dat haar zuurstoflevels gevaarlijk laag waren. Mary is enorm geschrokken: “De dokters legden uit dat als Sarah niet aan het vapen was, haar longen een grotere kans hadden om de infectie te bestrijden. Als ze iets later naar het ziekenhuis was gegaan had het heel anders kunnen aflopen, dat is iets waar ik niet eens over kan nadenken.” De infectie had een enorme impact op haar lichaam: “Ze zat aan de kabels, buisjes en machines, het was hartverscheurend. Als moeder voel je je zo machteloos, het was een ware nachtmerrie.” aldus Mary. “Ik heb 3 andere kinderen en het was zo moeilijk om hen uit te leggen wat er gebeurde. Ze vroegen me of Sarah dood zou gaan en ik antwoordde ’natuurlijk niet!’, maar in mijn hoofd was ik doodsbang voor die mogelijkheid.” Langetermijnrisico’s onbekend. Maar gelukkig mocht Sarah na 3 dagen van de beademingsmachine af en ontwaakte ze uit haar coma. Op dit moment is ze thuis aan het herstellen. De familie deelt Sarahs verhaal als onderdeel van een campagne die kinderen moet weerhouden om zo jong te starten met vapen. Fidelma Carter, hoofd van publieke gezondheid bij Northern Ireland Chest Heart Heart & Stroke, zegt dat het grootste misverstand is dat vapen minder schadelijk is dan een sigaret. “Het is simpelweg niet waar. De boodschap moet snel aankomen bij jonge kinderen voordat ze verslaafd raken aan de elektrische variant van de sigaret, omdat ze denken dat deze risicovrij is. De langetermijn-risico’s zijn nog onbekend, net als dat ooit bij roken het geval was.” LEES OOK.

HERALDO te propone cinco variedades de ponerse el pañuelo durante estas fiestas que, seguro, te encantarán. Desde el los colores de moda en la capital aragonesa son el rojo y el negro. Y, a medida que pasan los años, cada vez se ven más los cachirulos en diferentes partes del cuerpo y no solo en el cuello o en la muñeca (los más tradicionales). Cada año surgen ideas nuevas y creativas, de hecho, existen los nuevos cachirulos que ya tienen forma de pulsera o coletero y han abandonado la de pañuelo.  Como se puede ver en el vídeo, anudarse el pañuelo de cuadros rojos y negros en el cuello es la manera tradicional 'al estilo peñista' , siempre que se vea por delante, aunque hay quienes prefieren anudarlo por detrás y que la forma de triángulo descanse en la espalda. Muy común también es verlo anudado en la muñeca y los más atrevidos en la cabeza, 'al estilo pirata' . Pero, no son las únicas formas de anudarse el cachirulo, te dejamos dos más, muy de moda ahora.  El cachirulo como coletero Cuando el calor aprieta en una discoteca, en un concierto o en un acto cultural, muchas personas con el pelo largo optan por colocarse el cachirulo en el pelo a modo de coletero para apartarse la melena de la cara y pasar menos calor. El cachirulo en la cintura Y, desde hace unos años, se ve mucho también la opción de utilizar el pañuelo de fiestas como cinturón. De esta forma, lo utilizamos como complemento perfecto a un 'outfit' peñista o festivo.  Historia del cachirulo. Su historia se remonta a la época musulmana . Los moriscos tenían costumbre de cubrirse la cabeza con piezas cuadradas de lino dobladas y anudadas para secarse el sudor y esquivar el polvo durante las jornadas en el campo.

423374567,"800 Noticias. La rutina de cuidados es uno de esos momentos del día que nos permiten conectar con nosotras mismas y sentirnos mejor con nuestro cuerpo. La rutina capilar es esencial para poder combatir el daño, deshidratación, sequedad y la falta de vida que puede sufrir nuestro cabello. Una de las afecciones que pueden derivar a que tengamos un mayor cuidado de nuestro pelo es la conocida porosidad capilar. Tener melena porosa puede parecer un desafío, pero en realidad es una oportunidad para conocer un poco más nuestro cabello. La porosidad capilar tiene que ver con cuánta humedad puede absorber y retener el cabello. Se puede dividir en dos tipos: alta que absorbe mucha agua y baja que retiene agua. Esta porosidad no es estática y puede cambiar con el tiempo, haciéndolo también nuestro pelo. Factores como la exposición prolongada a los rayos UV, la decoloración, los tratamientos químicos o el uso frecuente de herramientas de calor, pueden dañar nuestro cabello y provocar que el nivel de porosidad aumente. Si no sabes si tienes el pelo poroso, el diagnóstico es sencillo. Es fácil saber su existencia ya que éste se seca o moja muy rápido, se enreda con facilidad, se encrespa o tiene una textura áspera. Además de romperse a menudo y no mantener un peinado por mucho tiempo. María García, responsable de experiencia de cliente de Dalire, nos cuenta como podemos tratar y combatir la porosidad de la manera más eficaz posible. Tips para tratar el cabello muy poroso. 1. Evita cualquier tipo de agresión . Deja a un lado las herramientas muy calientes y los tratamientos agresivos . El uso excesivo de agentes secantes, tratamientos químicos, herramientas térmicas como planchas y secadores y la exposición al sol pueden afectar la porosidad de tu cabello. “Todo ello, elimina la hidratación y puede dañar la cutícula, haciéndolo aún más poroso. Un buen protector solar intensivo con keratina, es la mejor manera de protegerlo de los daños y reparar la cutícula”, nos aconseja María García , responsable de experiencia de cliente de la firma sevillana Dalire. 2. Mantén siempre el cabello hidratado . El cabello con un alto porcentaje de porosidad es frágil. Evita el exceso de cepillado y lavado, y céntrate en mantenerlo muy hidratado ya que estará protegido y tendrá más salud y brillo. Si quieres conseguir una hidratación en profundidad utiliza una mascarilla o crema nutritiva. 3. Seca tu pelo de manera natural . El cabello suele secarse de manera rápida así que opta por dejar que se seque al aire. 4. Protege tu color . Si tu pelo está teñido o con mechas puede ocurrir que los pigmentos se caigan con facilidad debido a esas cutículas que están sueltas. Utilizar un champú morado puede ser perfecto para mantener el color y mejorar la salud de tu pelo. Dalire tiene la solución ya que cuenta con un champú morado y sin sulfatos. 5. Utiliza productos cremosos y nutritivos . Tener el cabello nutrido e hidratado es esencial. Elige productos que estén compuestos por coco keratina jojoba o manteca de karité para así sellar la hidratación y alimentar el cabello. 6. Incorpora un prechampú a tu tratamiento . Las cutículas pueden absorber proteínas y aceites hidratantes como esponjas. Por lo que, escoge fórmulas ricas en aceites y nutrientes. 7. Opta por peinados naturales . El cabello poroso no mantiene los peinados durante horas. En el caso de que sea necesario, usa productos de fijación fuerte.

423356965,"'We were all struggling, and they were pushing us so hard to not stop,' Talarico said. Carla didn’t think much of it when she didn’t hear from Gates at lunchtime as usual. He sometimes skipped lunch so he could finish his route on time. Gates was so punctual that one resident, an autistic child, would wait for him on the front porch at the same time every day. Gates’s customers told Talaricio, 'You could set your clock by Gino.' But around 3:35 pm , Gates collapsed in front of a home in the Caruth Terrace neighborhood in northeast Dallas. The homeowner performed CPR. According to city records, the fire department arrived five minutes later and brought Gates to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. According to medical records, his body temperature was 104.6 when he reached the hospital. The hospital called Carla at 4:45 pm . As she rushed to the hospital, she received a second call, this time from the chaplain who said she would talk to Carla when she arrived. That was when Carla knew Gates had already died before she got a chance to say goodbye. It wasn’t until nearly a week later, when Gate’s story made national news, that someone from the USPS finally returned Carla’s calls. 'They did not reach out to me. They did not send a card. They did not send flowers. The postal service did not send anything. Any support I received was from the union, his coworkers, and residents around the country,' Carla said. 'That’s how they treat someone after 36 years of service.' Gates is the seventh documented USPS mail carrier to die from heat-related illness since 2012 while on the job, according to the Observer ’s analysis of federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) records. The number of deaths may be higher since neither medical records nor OSHA always cite whether heat stress might induce other illnesses. Since OSHA first cited USPS for exposing Independence, Mo., mail carrier John Watzlawick to heat hazards on July 24, 2012, the USPS has been slow to make changes to protect workers. USPS Mail Carrier Heat-related Fatalities 2012–23 July 24, 2012, Independence, Mo.: John Watzlawick died delivering mail when the temperature hit 102 degrees. July 6, 2013, Medford, Mass.: James Baldassarre died from a heat stroke. The temperature was 94 degrees; the heat index was 117. July 11, 2017, Charleston, W.Va: Ronnie Bowles died after experiencing heart problems induced by heat stress. The heat index was 88. July 6, 2018, Woodland Hills, Calif.: Peggy Frank died in a non-air-conditioned mail truck. The temperature hit a record-setting high of 115. July 22, 2020, Washington, D.C.: A mail carrier died in a non-air-conditioned vehicle. The high temperature was 94 degrees, and the heat index was 104. June 17, 2021, San Jose, Calif.: Dalvir Bassi died from a heat stroke. The temperature was 94 degrees. June 20, 2023, Dallas, Tex.: Eugene Gates died when the temperature hit 98 degrees with a heat index of 116. (source: OSHA) After Watzlawick’s death, the USPS agreed to a limited heat-illness prevention program that would include Independence, Missouri. The program wasn’t instituted nationally until May 2018. By then, 62 more USPS carriers around the country had been hospitalized for severe heat-related illnesses, according to the Observer’s analysis of OSHA records. At least two others had died. In the summer of 2020, mail carriers were dealt a blow after USPS won an administrative law judge decision that overturned an OSHA penalty of $511,000 for five heat-related injuries. Without a specific OSHA standard for heat safety, judges decided that the mail carriers’ unprotected exposure to extreme heat did not qualify as a 'hazard likely to cause death or serious physical harm' under OSHA’s general duty clause, which requires employers to provide general protections for a safe workplace. But, according to OSHA records, from 2015 to 2022, heat-related injuries accounted for 173 of 1,200 severe injuries—16 percent—among USPS carriers that required hospitalization. This does not include the heat illnesses experienced by mail carriers during the extreme heat this summer. According to the data, Texas mail carriers experienced the most hospitalizations from work-related heat illnesses. The state had 28 recorded incidents, compared to 10 in Nevada, which came second. Notably, even though USPS is not the largest employer in the United States, it employs roughly half the workers at Walmart, Amazon, or McDonald’s—its workers reported the highest number of severe workplace injuries overall, 1,200 over that same period. After years of resistance by business lobbyists , OSHA finally began developing a heat safety standard two years ago. Progress has been slow, but protests by workers, unions, organizations, and elected officials—like Texas Representative Greg Casar, who staged a thirst strike this past summer—have recently spurred the Biden administration to ramp up enforcement of heat-related workplace protections. The Observer found that the USPS, on the other hand, continues to resist these efforts. In early July, US Representative for the Dallas area Jasmine Crockett, Representatives Jamie Raskin, Greg Casar, and 12 others initiated a congressional inquiry into the USPS’s measures to protect its workforce from extreme heat. Casar, with other local representatives, also sent a separate letter to USPS Postmaster General Louis DeJoy calling on the agency to allow mail carriers to be able to return to their post office or deviate from their route to obtain cold water, without receiving disciplinary action. According to communication the Observer reviewed between Casar and USPS District Manager Tom Billington, the USPS refused to agree to the request, and wrote instead, 'If they can’t find water [along their route], they should contact their supervisor for assistance and to discuss alternative solutions for hydration.' This past summer, San Antonio branches stopped providing cold water to mail carriers. 'The way that USPS has treated San Antonio letter carriers during this summer’s heat wave is inexcusable,' said Casar. 'They have been misleading to members of Congress, gone back on their word, and created a dangerous working environment.' In responses to both the congressional inquiry and to Casar, USPS Government Relations Representative Ashley Motta sent a letter touting the HIPP’s provisions, which mail carriers say the USPS is flouting. 'It’s apparent that there is a significant number of locations that did not complete the training and there’s also a sizable number of discrepancies in terms of what USPS’s records show. It shows that the training was completed, but it wasn’t and that’s something we’re in the process of correcting,' said NALC President Brian Renfroe, who added that the union is also calling on the USPS to update the HIPP to include heat acclimatization measures. 'I was on vacation, and when I was looking at my records on Liteblue (the online portal for postal employees), it showed I did some additional training on my day off, but that never happened, and on Sunday, which also never happened,' one union survey respondent said. Another wrote that her training was marked complete when 'I just came out of the hospital and was on bed rest for 11 weeks.' One other mail carrier wrote her training was marked complete when 'I was out recovering from a heart procedure because I received a LOW [letter of warning] for attendance because of my absence.' Homer Hernandez, a USPS mail carrier of 20 years and legislative chair of the San Antonio branch, said many mail carriers in San Antonio also reported that their records were falsified. 'We found out that they were falsifying all our documents by stating we took all the safety training classes they’re supposed to be providing us when it never happened,' Hernandez said. Gates never took the HIPP training this year. He had been absent on January 25, when it was administered at the Lakewood post office. But, like others, his training record was also marked as complete. For the USPS, 'nothing comes above the numbers,' wrote one mail carrier. At the start of the pandemic, USPS paid the Zebra Technologies Corporation $570 million to provide 300,000 of its TC77 model as their new Mobile Delivery Device, scanners that allow for 'real-time tracking' of packages and carriers. The company boasted, 'The ultra-rugged TC77 features Zebra’s Mobility DNA suite of software tools that increase worker productivity, simplify management and strengthen the security of Zebra’s Android-based, enterprise-class computers.' The devices are connected to USPS’s Regional Intelligent Mail Server, or RIMS, which allows management to track a carrier’s progress on their delivery route at all times. At the start of a day, carriers discuss with management how long a given route will take. Typically, they cannot deviate from that route. If a carrier is stationary after a few minutes, a red blinking sign on the RIMS system will alert management that the carrier is 'idle.' If mail carriers take longer than the estimated time, they may be disciplined for 'unauthorized overtime.' If they 'idle,' they may be disciplined for 'stationary events,' although Renfroe says this often violates the workers’ contracts. 'Determining each carrier’s progress early in the afternoon will allow the supervisor to know which carriers are behind schedule and take appropriate action,' the USPS’s Office of Inspector General wrote of the Mobile Delivery Device system. Texas’s NALC leaders from Dallas, San Antonio, and Killen say that before Gates died, carriers were routinely disciplined for 'stationary events' when they sought breaks from the heat. Even though the online HIPP training course tells carriers to 'slow down the pace' or 'shorten the duration by taking frequent breaks as needed,' USPS management regularly sent carriers warnings on their scanners saying 'keep moving' or 'hurry up to beat the heat.' 'If a carrier is found to be idle, not moving for about 10 minutes, then management wants to know why. They feel like it’s excessive. We, on the other hand, as the union is concerned, have told them to take as many conferences [breaks] to make sure that their health is protected. But the Postal Service frowns upon that,' NALC Dallas-branch 132 president Lewis said. (Courtesy of Kimetra Lewis) After a verbal warning, USPS management will escalate disciplinary measures to a warning letter, a seven-day suspension, a 14-day suspension, and then removal. The system discourages carriers from taking breaks, even when their bodies need to cool down. The timing is critical. Without immediate attention and rest, extended exposure to heat can result in nausea, dizziness, and fainting, which when left untreated can lead to a breakdown of the kidneys and other organs, and then death. According to union grievance records, mail carriers were also disciplined for taking leave when they did get sick. After Gates died, management started sending warning messages to mail carriers’ personal phones instead of scanners. Killeen’s NALC Branch 4217 President John Darden said carriers received text messages, such as, 'What’s taking you so long?,' 'You should’ve been done by now,' and 'Why are you still there?' Darden said there have been nine heat illnesses among Killeen mail carriers since Gates died. Heat stress induced one carrier’s heart attack. Another mail carrier’s kidney failed from heat exhaustion after he had received a transplant a year prior. He’s been out sick for a month now. Even with all the illnesses, USPS moved the start times for the Killeen mail carriers back to 8:30 am September 9, when temperatures topped 104 degrees. 'They just don’t care,' Darden said. Dallas-area mail carrier Charlie loved the Texas heat. He loved the outdoors and hated being cooped up in an office. That’s why, at the age of 31, after running a printing press for a few years, Charlie decided to deliver mail for the postal service. 'Growing up, I was always playing outdoors. It was like the hotter, the better. And I wanted to get out and meet new people,' said Charlie, who requested we use only his first name or fear of retaliation from USPS management. But after collapsing, losing consciousness, and being hospitalized three times from heat strokes, Charlie now starts to get nauseous even from the sun’s glare inside a car. After the first heat stroke five years ago, Charlie noticed he couldn’t be outdoors as long. The second time, a year later, Charlie made it through his route, but then collapsed before he and his son found their seats at a Rangers ballgame later that day. Recently, on his delivery route July 31 at around 4:30 pm , he noticed the first signs of an oncoming heat injury. His hands cramped. He gasped for breath. It was 103 degrees. Charlie called his supervisor, who told him to rest a little before continuing. He then worked for another 15 minutes before he realized he couldn’t go on. He called his supervisor again. 'I told him I didn’t think I could finish. So then he asked me if I could just get rid of the packages,' Charlie said. Charlie sat for another 20 minutes. Another carrier arrived to take some of his mail. 'He’s not looking good,' the other carrier told the supervisor on the phone. But Charlie got up and completed his deliveries on another street, then went on to another before he collapsed. His kidneys had failed. It took him days after he was hospitalized to be able to go to the bathroom again. 'My managers pressure us because they tell us they’re being pressured from above. They’ll send out messages on people’s scanners saying everyone must come back by a certain time.' Pressure has been building up for the past three years, when Charlie and his coworkers have been forced by a labor shortage to take on more routes and work overtime. US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said last summer that the USPS needed to shed 50,000 employees, as the agency looks to consolidate post offices into larger distribution centers. Charlie spoke to the Observer over the phone in short, breathy gasps, a belabored voice. After more than a month since his last accident, he says his head still pounds and swirls. He staggers now when he walks. 'This time, it hit me much harder than the previous ones. I feel like my balance is just not there. I’m off,' he said. At 53, he’s young for a grandfather. But he said he can no longer go outside to play with his grandkids to push them on the swings or help them set up their wading pool. 'I’m scared after all this, that I won’t even be able to do my job anymore.'",9578,struggle push hard stop talarico say carla think hear gates lunchtime usual skip lunch finish route time gates

423356676,"Co to jest hipoksja? Rodzaje. Niedotlenienie organizmu może mieć różne przyczyny, wynikające zarówno z patologii obejmującej układ oddechowy, jak i krążeniowy . W związku z tym klasyfikacja tej dolegliwości opiera się o to, co stoi za hipoksją tkanek organizmu. Są to m.in.: hipoksja hipoksyczna, hipoksja anemiczna, hipoksja krążeniowa, hipoksja dyfuzyjna. Hipoksja hipoksyczna. U ludzi chorych hipoksja hipoksyczna występuje jako efekt chorób wpływających na pracę pęcherzyków płucnych , niekiedy stanowi powikłanie chorób zapalnych układu oddechowego. Najbardziej znaną i niebezpieczną chorobą tego typu jest POChP, czyli przewlekła obturacyjna choroba płuc dotykająca osoby palące tytoń oraz e-papierosy. U zdrowych osób występuje inny wariant tej dolegliwości, hipoksja wysokościowa, która pojawia się np. podczas wspinaczek górskich Hipoksja anemiczna. O hipoksji anemicznej mówi się, kiedy czerwone krwinki nie są w stanie wiązać atomów tlenu w odpowiedniej liczbie, aby doprowadzić je do wszystkich komórek organizmu. Taka sytuacja może mieć miejsce, gdy erytrocytów jest za mało – a więc kiedy doszło do silnego, obfitego krwawienia , ale także w przebiegu chorób nowotworowych wpływających na cykl życia czerwonych krwinek oraz ich budowę. Do hipoksji anemicznej dochodzi także wtedy, gdy pacjent zatruje się tlenkiem węgla. Hipoksja krążeniowa. Hipoksja krążeniowa pojawia się u pacjentów, którzy cierpią na zaburzenia układu krążenia . Ma miejsce, gdy z jakiegoś powodu krew nie przepływa w odpowiednim tempie oraz ilości, a więc najczęściej w sytuacji, kiedy dochodzi do problemów związanych z pracą serca Hipoksja dyfuzyjna. Ostre zatrucia są częstą przyczyną niewydolności oddechowej. (...) Objawy zatruć dotyczące układu oddechowego są ściśle związane z mechanizmem działania toksyn. Podstawowym objawem jest zaburzenie częstości oddechu. W przebiegu zatruć możemy obserwować zarówno przyspieszenie oddechu (alkohol metylowy, amfetamina, anilina, benzen, kokaina cyjanki tlenek węgla) jak również jego zwolnienie (etanol, benzyna, morfina, pochodne kwasu barbiturowego). Kolejnym częstym objawem może być duszność i nadmiernie wyrażona praca mięśni oddechowych (etanol, metanol, cyjanki, cyjanowodór, kokaina, rozpuszczalniki organiczne, trójpierścieniowe leki przeciwdepresyjne, związki fosforoorganiczne). Zatrucia gazami drażniącymi, reakcje anafilaktyczne i anafilaktoidalne po antybiotykach, ukąszeniu przez owady błonkoskrzydłe, zatrucia nieselektywnymi beta adrenolitykami oraz pochodnymi kwasu salicylowego manifestować się mogą masywnym skurczem oskrzeli.",9578,co jest hipoksja rodzaje niedotlenienie organizmu może mieć różne przyczyny wynikające zarówno z patologii obejmującej układ oddechowy jak krążeniowy w związku z tym klasyfikacja tej dolegliwości opiera się o co stoi za hipoksją tkanek organizmu są hipoksja hipoksyczna hipoksja anemiczna hipoksja krążeniowa hipoksja dyfuzyjna hipoksja hipoksyczna u ludzi chorych hipoksja hipoksyczna występuje jako efekt chorób wpływających na pracę pęcherzyków płucnych niekiedy stanowi powikłanie chorób zapalnych układu oddechowego najbardziej znaną niebezpieczną chorobą tego typu jest pochp czyli przewlekła obturacyjna choroba płuc dotykająca osoby palące tytoń oraz e papierosy u zdrowych osób występuje inny wariant tej dolegliwości hipoksja wysokościowa która pojawia się np podczas wspinaczek górskich hipoksja anemiczna o hipoksji anemicznej mówi się kiedy czerwone krwinki nie są w stanie wiązać atomów tlenu w odpowiedniej liczbie aby doprowadzić je wszystkich komórek organizmu taka sytuacja może mieć miejsce gdy erytrocytów jest za mało więc kiedy doszło silnego obfitego krwawienia ale także w przebiegu chorób nowotworowych wpływających na cykl życia czerwonych krwinek oraz ich budowę hipoksji anemicznej dochodzi także wtedy gdy pacjent zatruje się tlenkiem węgla hipoksja krążeniowa hipoksja krążeniowa pojawia się u pacjentów którzy cierpią na zaburzenia układu krążenia ma miejsce gdy z jakiegoś powodu krew nie przepływa w odpowiednim tempie oraz ilości więc najczęściej w sytuacji kiedy dochodzi problemów związanych z pracą serca hipoksja dyfuzyjna ostre zatrucia są częstą przyczyną niewydolności oddechowej objawy zatruć dotyczące układu oddechowego są ściśle związane z mechanizmem działania toksyn podstawowym objawem jest zaburzenie częstości oddechu w przebiegu zatruć możemy obserwować zarówno przyspieszenie oddechu alkohol metylowy amfetamina anilina benzen kokaina cyjanki tlenek węgla jak również jego zwolnienie etanol benzyna morfina pochodne kwasu barbiturowego kolejnym częstym objawem może być duszność nadmiernie wyrażona praca mięśni oddechowych etanol metanol cyjanki cyjanowodór kokaina rozpuszczalniki organiczne trójpierścieniowe leki przeciwdepresyjne związki fosforoorganiczne zatrucia gazami drażniącymi reakcje anafilaktyczne anafilaktoidalne po antybiotykach ukąszeniu przez owady błonkoskrzydłe zatrucia nieselektywnymi beta adrenolitykami oraz pochodnymi kwasu salicylowego manifestować się mogą masywnym skurczem oskrzeli
423357217,"Цитомегаловирусная инфекция — достаточно распространенное заболевание. К пяти годам оно есть почти у каждого третьего ребенка, а к 40 годам у более чем половины взрослого населения. Какие симптомы указывают на наличие цитомегаловируса в организме и можно ли его вылечить, рассказывают «Известия». Что такое цитомегаловирус. Цитомегаловирус (ЦМВ) относится к одной из разновидностей герпеса. У здорового человека вирус никак себя не проявляет, однако он может быть крайне опасен для людей с ослабленным иммунитетом. Прежде всего, для больных, перенесших трансплантацию органов, ВИЧ-инфицированных и новорожденных детей. Также он может проявить себя на фоне длительного приема лекарственных препаратов, болезни или контакта с больным. При подавленном иммунитете вирус активизируется, вызывая клинические симптомы. В случае отсутствия своевременного лечения он способен поразить глаза, легкие, печень, желудок, кишечник и другие органы. Инкубационный период обычно составляет до двух месяцев, длится заболевание в среднем от двух до шести недель. Пути заражения цитомегаловирусом. Вирус выделяется во внешнюю среду с различными биологическими жидкостями человека. Чаще всего заражение происходит воздушно-капельным, пищевым или половым путем. Заразиться можно и при переливании крови или при трансплантации органов от донора с цитомегаловирусной инфекцией. Новорожденный ребенок, как правило, заражается от матери через грудное молоко или еще во время беременности. Если цитомегаловирус однажды уже попал в организм, то человек на всю жизнь остается носителем этой инфекции. Выявить вирус можно только с помощью лабораторных исследований. Иногда проводят биопсию и компьютерную томографию, чтобы определить изменения во внутренних органах. Симптомы цитомегаловируса. Часто заболевание протекает бессимптомно. В некоторых случаях могут появиться признаки, характерные при ОРВИ: боли в горле, увеличение лимфоузлов, сухой кашель и температура. Выявить вирус можно только с помощью лабораторных исследований. Иногда проводят биопсию и компьютерную томографию, чтобы определить изменения во внутренних органах. Как лечить цитомегаловирус. При легкой форме цитомегаловируса лечение обычно не назначают, так как иммунитет справляется с возбудителем инфекции самостоятельно. Когда проявляются характерные симптомы, врач может прописать противовирусный препарат или иммуномодуляторы для укрепления иммунитета. Лечение детей, инфицированных цитомегаловирусом, включает диету, режим, этиотропные препараты, а также иммунотерапию.

423356675,"Jak leczyć kaszel palacza? Proces leczenia kaszlu palacza opiera się przede wszystkim na farmakoterapii , a więc różnych tabletkach, syropach i lekach na receptę. Najprostszym, a zarazem najtrudniejszym dla osoby uzależnionej sposobem na wyeliminowanie kaszlu jest po prostu . Niestety w wielu przypadkach jest to wyjątkowo trudne, wymaga ogromnej motywacji wewnętrznej, stosowania dodatkowych farmaceutyków, a czasami także psychoterapii. W aptekach można znaleźć spory wybór tabletek i syropów na kaszel palacza, jednak należy je dobrać odpowiednio do swoich objawów. W sytuacji, gdy u danej osoby występuje suchy kaszel, to najlepsze będą preparaty nawilżające, natomiast w przypadku odkrztuszania nadmiernej wydzieliny dobrze kupić lek o działaniu rozrzedzającym. Domowe sposoby na kaszel palacza Osoba z uporczywym kaszlem zwykle poszukuje domowych metod na pozbycie się tego symptomu . Do najważniejszych sposobów można zakwalifikować: picie naparów z tymianku, korzenia podbiału, anyżu, wyciągów z lawendy, stosowanie syropów i tabletek bez recepty, zażywanie środków wykrztuśnych, inhalacje olejkami eterycznymi syropy z cebuli lub kurkumy, picie herbaty z imbirem, oklepywanie pleców nawilżanie pomieszczeń. Większość tych metod działa jednak tylko na krótką metę, zwłaszcza gdy dana osoba nie rezygnuje ze swojego uzależnienia.  Palenie papierosów oraz innych wyrobów tytoniowych to nadal jeden z głównych zabójców Polaków. Odpowiedzialne jest za ok. 40% przedwczesnych zgonów wśród mężczyzn. Z powodu chorób odtytoniowych każdego roku umiera w Polsce przedwcześnie ponad 60 tys. osób. To 14 razy więcej niż ofiar wypadków drogowych. Skala palenia tytoniu doprowadziła do epidemii chorób odtytoniowych i pogorszenia się stanu zdrowia społeczeństwa polskiego. Papierosy przyczyniają się do zachorowania nie tylko na nowotwory płuc, ale także wiele innych chorób, m.in.: zawał serca, zakrzepicę żył oraz przewlekłą obturacyjną chorobę płuc (POChP) – przewlekłe zapalenie oskrzeli i rozedma płuc. Szacuje się, że w Polsce na POChP choruje ok. 2 miliony osób, co stanowi 5% społeczeństwa. Serwis Ministerstwa Zdrowia i Narodowego Funduszu Zdrowia, https://pacjent.gov.pl/program-profilaktyczny/program-profilaktyki-chorob-odtytoniowych. Rzucenie palenia jako sposób na kaszel Już po kilku godzinach po rzuceniu palenia poprawia się krążenie krwi , a po dobie organizm usuwa nadmiar dwutlenku węgla. Niestety kilkanaście godzin po wypaleniu ostatniego papierosa może pojawić się nagły kaszel , oznaczający rozpoczęcie procesu oczyszczania płuc. Ten symptom przechodzi jednak po kilku miesiącach, a więc w momencie, gdy organizm nie ma w sobie już tylu toksyn. Można więc uznać, że około 10 miesięcy po rzuceniu palenia kaszel nie występuje. Rezygnacja z nałogu niesie ze sobą znacznie więcej pozytywnych skutków , dlatego warto się na to zdecydować jak najszybciej. W aptekach dostępne są różne środki wspomagające proces rzucenie palenia takie jak plastry, gumy, tabletki. Możesz też umówić się na wizytę do psychologa lub lekarza POZ , którzy mogą także zaproponować inne, bardziej profesjonalne metody walki z nałogiem.

423353923,"Arriva dopo anni nella città che ne è protagonista assoluta 'Sanghenapule - Vita straordinaria di San Gennaro' lo spettacolo di Roberto Saviano e Mimmo Borrelli che apre venerdi 13 ottobre la stagione del Teatro Bellini e che debuttò al Piccolo Teatro Grassi il 5 aprile 2016. L'opera intreccia il racconto alla poesia, esaltando la lingua napoletana in tutta la sua barocca bellezza. Mimmo Borrelli, che firma anche la regia di questo riallestimento, e il narratore Roberto Saviano puntano al cuore di Napoli, città di sangue e di lava incandescente, esplorandone mistero e contraddizioni. Attore e scrittore percorrono alcune tappe della storia napoletana in una continua osmosi tra celeste e sotterraneo. È il sangue il filo conduttore tra parole, luci e suoni, con una colonna sonora originale eseguita dal vivo. Si parte naturalmente dal sangue che si scioglie e che rinnova anno dopo anno il patto tra il santo e la sua gente, quello dei primi martiri cristiani, ma anche quello dei martiri laici della Repubblica partenopea di fine Settecento. E ancora è l'emorragia dell'emigrazione nei primi decenni del Novecento, il sangue versato sotto le bombe della Seconda Guerra mondiale, è infine, quello degli agguati di camorra di oggi. Musiche, esecuzione ed elettronica sono di Gianluca Catuogno e Antonio Della Ragione, scene Luigi Ferrigno, costumi Enzo Pirozzi, luci Salvatore Palladino, sound design Alessio Foglia.

423353761,"O transtorno de ansiedade é uma doença mental que acomete muitas pessoas. Segundo dados da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS), em 2019, 18,6 milhões de brasileiros conviviam com esse problema. Resumidamente, a ansiedade é caracterizada pelo sentimento de preocupação exagerado e contínuo. A seguir, a psicóloga Priscila Teixeira esclarece alguns mitos e verdades sobre a doença. Confira! 1. Ansiedade tem cura? Mito. Os transtornos de ansiedade não têm cura. Eles possuem um prognóstico diferente, ou seja, evolui de maneira diferente em cada paciente. Há pacientes que fazem o tratamento adequado e não voltam a ter nenhum episódio ao longo da vida. 2. Animais de estimação podem ajudar pessoas ansiosas? Verdade. Existem muitos estudos que mostram o benefício de um para pacientes com transtorno de ansiedade e depressão. Segundo dados de um estudo elaborado pela Human Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI), com 2 mil pessoas com pets , 74% relataram uma melhora na saúde mental em decorrência da relação com o animal de estimação e 75% relataram melhora da saúde mental de um amigo ou familiar devido à presença de um pet 3. Tomar remédios é o único jeito de controlar a ansiedade? Mito. O uso da medicação é uma das formas de tratamento. Lembrando que é necessário o acompanhamento com o médico psiquiatra. É importante também que o paciente realize psicoterapia com um profissional respeitável e autorizado pelo Conselho Regional de Psicologia. Existem outras formas de tratamento que não substituem o acompanhamento com o médico e o psicólogo, mas que podem contribuir, como os tratamentos naturais, , prática de hobbies e atividades de lazer. 5. Exercícios respiratórios podem ajudar nas crises de ansiedade? Verdade. Em uma crise de ansiedade, temos como um dos sintomas a falta de ar e os batimentos cardíacos acelerados. Nossa respiração fica mais curta e rasa e, por isso, falta oxigênio no corpo. Exercícios de respiração ajudam a estender o tempo da expiração e equalizar a respiração. Por fim, conseguimos obter uma coerência cardíaca e chegar em um estado de bem-estar. É interessante realizar a prática todos os dias. 6. Existem medicamentos para o tratamento da ansiedade? Verdade. Existem e são chamados de psicofármacos ou psicotrópicos, que são grupos de substâncias químicas que trabalham no sistema nervoso central. Existem dezenas na indústria farmacêutica em nosso país e o seu uso vai depender da orientação profissional médica, por isso, a necessidade do acompanhamento com o psiquiatra. 7. Algumas bebidas intensificam os sintomas dessa doença? Verdade. O álcool deve ser evitado para ajudar no controle da ansiedade, assim como alguns , como farinha branca, açúcar, bebidas açucaradas (energéticos e refrigerantes) e cafeína. Esses alimentos interferem nos níveis de diversos neurotransmissores e acabam funcionando como estimulantes. 8. Lugares ou objetos podem gerar crises de ansiedade? Verdade. Um indivíduo com transtorno de ansiedade pode ficar mais sensível diante de uma situação do cotidiano. Alguns lugares, objetos e até mesmo cheiros podem agir como gatilhos para o surgimento de sintomas, ou seja, eles estão relacionados a uma vivência anterior que aquela pessoa teve e, com esse novo contato, despertam esses sentimentos e emoções.

Le parquet a requis l'acquittement contre la mère de l'enfant, également poursuivie pour cette prévention de violence. Le décès de l'enfant âgé d'un mois a été constaté aux urgences de l'hôpital le 19 juin 2016, entraînant l'ouverture d'une enquête pour déterminer la cause du décès.

Emma Gorrick, 37, lost her battle on Tuesday morning while holding both her husband, Dave's, and sister's hands. The Sydney woman had spent upwards of $350,000 on cancer treatments to prolong her life in an attempt to watch her children grow up. Her extraordinary efforts resulted in Emma living for two years - after doctors gave her she had just two months to live. In her final post to Facebook , Emma told her friends and family on September 29 that times had 'been pretty tough lately' as her health and the family's finances started to dwindle. 'Emergency trips have finally calmed down although most of the time I'm still incredibly weak,' she wrote. 'Most of the time (I'm) not feeling great so I barely get to do anything or see anyone. The determined mother had previously beaten breast cancer in 2011 at just 25-years-old. But the cruel disease returned this time with a terminal diagnosis and she suffered from horrific symptoms - including dizzy spells, blackouts, constant nausea and vomiting. She was bedridden for much of the day and relied on her husband to car for her. 'I'm not eating as much as normal anymore, mine and Dave's mental heath have really lowered, we have run out of finances so the stress is through the roof,' she wrote in her post. 'It has been tears and tears all the time lately just longing for my life back trying to get myself out of the depression hole I fell in but we will get there. 'We are an incredible team and we can get through it all. 'It's just a slow and steady process of staying positive and working through it all. I'm down to 1 doc now with no other appointments to save as much as we can.' Her post finishes with her saying she believed she 'can still do this, I just know I can'.

A vítima, também ela turista, conheceu outros quatro viajantes num local de diversão, localizado na Plaza de Toros, revela a agência Europa Press. O mesmo meio destaca que, após uma conversa e algumas cervejas, a jovem afirma não ter memória dos acontecimentos até à manhã seguinte, quando acordou num outro hotel que não era o seu. A mulher relata que acordou vestida, mas não tinha roupa interior. Desorientada, pediu ajuda na receção do hotel. A Polícia Nacional foi acionada para o local e ativou o protocolo de agressão sexual. À chegada, os agentes constataram que a mulher estava semiconsciente, com falta de capacidades motoras e com vómitos. Por isso, foi encaminhada para uma unidade hospitalar para serem realizados exames toxicológicos.

423396720,"Geert de Groot. Wat was het leukste tijdens het schrijven van uw laatste boek? Ik vind het schrijven altijd leuk. Dan kan ik, vreemd genoeg, de wereld aan door een nieuwe te scheppen. Het is als een aangename koorts waar ik mij in bevind, die al het andere verschroeit. Ik ben heel gelukkig als ik in zo'n schrijfkoorts zit. Alles wat er gebeurt heeft dan ook met dat boek te maken. Als ik bijvoorbeeld in de tram zit en ik hoor een raar zinnetje, dan schrijf ik het meteen op. Of als ik iemand zie die precies het neusje heeft dat mijn personage nodig heeft, dan leen ik die neus. Dat duurt meestal maar een jaar, anderhalf jaar. Dan moet ik me weer bijeenvegen. ‘Het verlangen me te verschuilen en onzichtbaar te zijn’ heeft u nooit verlaten, schrijft u in uw laatste boek. De kleine Adriaan ging onder de tafel zitten, hoe doet u dat tegenwoordig? Het is all in the mind: je kunt je gewoon verbeelden onzichtbaar te zijn. Je kunt je bijvoorbeeld mengen zonder dat de mensen weten dat je je met ze vermengt. Ik ben iemand die heel graag in parken zit, op bankjes, op terrassen. Ik heb hele grote oren en zie boven alle mensen een verhaal hangen, dat niet noodzakelijkerwijs een waar verhaal is. Dat is voor mij een vorm van onzichtbaarheid, want die mensen weten niet dat ik hun gedachten lees. Het klinkt alsof de deur van het gesticht open heeft gestaan, maar daarom is het gelukkig ook maar anderhalf jaar. Heeft u die staat van zijn zelf in de hand? Ik schrijf elke dag als oefening, om die spier sterk te houden, maar dat leidt niet altijd tot een boek. Op gegeven moment word ik dan narrig en vervelend, en weet ik: nu moet ik echt beginnen. Het komt dus vanuit mijzelf, maar een beetje aandrang omdat de bodem van de schatkist zichtbaar is, helpt ook. Het is innerlijke noodzaak én gezonde financiële noodzaak. Samuel Johnson zei eens: ‘Only a fool does not write for money.’ In uw laatste roman gaat u op onderzoek uit naar het verleden van Ommie, een vrouw die voor u de rol van oma had, maar niet uw oma was. Wat vond u in uw zoektocht naar Ommie? Al schrijvend kwam ik tot het besef dat ze veel meer voor onze familie heeft betekend dan we eigenlijk wisten. Zij accepteerde dat mijn moeder met een Molukse man en drie bruine meisjes thuiskwam. Dan blijkt ze ook nog zwanger te zijn van een praatjesmaker die nog een vrouw en twee kinderen in Indonesië heeft…. Dat was voor een hechte boerengemeenschap allemaal wel erg veel. Maar zij begreep het allemaal, accepteerde ons. Waar kwam die ruimdenkendheid vandaan? Doordat ze zelf in grote armoe was opgevoed en gekatapulteerd in een rijkere wereld, keek ze waarschijnlijk met een soort antropologische wijsheid naar de nieuwe wereld waar ze in zat. Ze wist dat er ook nog andere werelden waren. In de documentaire Adriaan van Dis, een wanhopig optimist kibbelt u met uw redacteur over een zinnetje waarin duidelijk wordt dat de verteller dingen verzint. Uw redacteur vond het niks omdat het de lezer uit het verhaal zou halen, maar u vond dat juist leuk. In uw laatste boek komt diezelfde drang om te spelen met verhaal en lezer ook weer terug. Zo schrijft u: ‘Alles is waar, behalve wat ik heb verzonnen…’ Vanwaar die behoefte? Het is waarschijnlijk ontstaan in het huis waar ik opgroeide, waar allemaal mensen uit Nederlands-Indië verhalen vertelden, waarvan het mij als klein jongetje begon op te vallen dat ik ze al tien keer had gehoord en ze elke keer anders waren. Waarom deden ze dat? Mensen houden ervan hun levensverhaal dragelijk te maken: mooier, erger, groter of kleiner. Ik dacht dat het allerleukste wat er bestond een Japans kamp was, want wat hadden ze gelachen. Maar ze vertelde natuurlijk niet dat er iemand dood was gegaan, dat mijn moeder een kind had verloren. Nee, ze hadden daar ontzettend plezier gemaakt om een jap die in de drek was uitgegleden. Is fantaseren zo ook een manier voor u om dingen te verwerken? Ook, ja. Ik ben in analyse geweest en dan vertel je ook een verhaal. Dan begin je bijvoorbeeld te zeggen: ‘Ik werd elke dag geslagen.’ Maar na een maand denk je: elke dag… of was het twee keer in de week? Dan ben je eerst een zielig jongetje en dan denk je: was ik eigenlijk wel zo zielig? Ik was ook een uitdagend jongetje. En zo verschuift het verhaal. Dat doe je zelf. Coen Verbraak zei eens dat hij zo onder de indruk is van hoe u uzelf vrij schreef van uw verleden. Ziet u dat ook zo? Nee, ik ben nog even gek als vroeger, maar ik heb het beter in de hand. Ik zie het aankomen als het misgaat. Wat is belangrijker: stijl of het verhaal? Stijl. Alles is stijl: lyriek, schoonheid, Proust! Er staat een tafeltje langs de Seine klaar, met een wit laken, twee wijnglazen, een kaars. Obers in jacquet staan paraat. Welk persoon uit de wereldliteratuur zou u voor een diner uitnodigen? Als ik dan toch in Parijs ben, nodig ik onmiddellijk Flaubert uit. Waar zouden jullie het over hebben? Over stijl, want van hem heb ik veel geleerd. Hij leest alles wat hij schrijft hardop. Ik heb mijn laatste boek drie keer hardop voorgelezen aan drie verschillende personen, en er toen nog veertig bladzijden uitgehaald. Dan wil ik met hem praten over hoe geweldig hij over de geschiedenis schrijft, die hij namelijk laat vertellen door de blik van een buitenstaander. In Leerschool der liefde kijkt een Franse ober in het revolutiejaar 1848 al glazen spoelend naar buiten en beschrijft wat hij op straat ziet; je weet meteen wat er aan de hand is. Zo knap. Tegen iedereen die wil gaan schrijven zeg ik: lees alle dode Fransen en Russen uit de 19e eeuw. U zei eens: ‘Ik heb een gelovige kern in mij, want ik hunker naar troost, maar ik geloof niet in God.’ Die troost vindt u in plaats daarvan in literatuur, zei u. Welk boek is uw bijbel? Toen ik heel somber was, heb ik alle korte verhalen van Tsjechov gelezen. Toen gingen de gordijnen weer open. Ik vind hem zo goed omdat hij een humane schrijver is en dus niet oordeelt, maar begrip heeft voor onze merkwaardigheid. Ik probeer ook zo in het leven te staan, kan er niet tegen als mensen bespot of belachelijk worden gemaakt. Naar televisieprogramma’s als Bananasplit of B&B Vol Liefde kan ik niet kijken. Na vijf minuten doet het mij pijn omdat die mensen bespot worden, of zichzelf bespotten. Welke vergeten schrijver zou meer gelezen moeten worden? Ik vind dat je elke dag een gedicht van Gerrit Achterberg moet lezen, een hele grote dichter. Of van Ida Gerhardt! De oude Nederlandse poëzie. Hendrik Marsman: geweldig! Dat houdt mij op de been. Ik zal er eentje voorlezen, even zoeken in mijn telefoon… Ah, kijk: Lex Barbarorum. Geef mij een mes. ik wil deze zwarte zieke plek uit mijn lichaam wegsnijden. ik heb mij langzaam recht overeind gezet. ik heb gehoord, dat ik heb gezegd in een huiverend, donker beven: ik erken maar één wet: léven. allen, die wegkwijnen aan een verdriet, verraden het en dat wìl ik niet. Welk boek heeft u aan het twijfelen gebracht? Al heel jong dacht ik dat ik niet een kind van mijn ouders was. Ik geloof dat Alleen op de Wereld van Hector Malot mij sterkte in de gedachte dat ik eigenlijk van adel was. Dat ik bij deze akelige, rare mensen was ondergebracht om een bescheiden jongen te worden. Maar, ooit zou er een gouden boog aan de horizon verschijnen en een rijke familie mij weer opnemen. Door dat romantische verlangen kun je ook de slaag van mijn vader ontvangen: hij weet dat je van adel bent, dus je verdient die slaag. Ik heb mijn hele leven van alles verhalen gemaakt om er beter mee te kunnen leven. Als u een schrijver kon zijn waar en wanneer dan ook, waar en wanneer zou dat dan zijn? Ik zou wel schrijver willen zijn over honderd jaar, omdat ik wil meemaken hoe de wereld zich langzamerhand robotiseert, hoe ik zelf met een chip in mijn lichaam best wel kan leven in een oververhitte wereld. En dan zou ik met verbazing terugkijken naar die schrijvers die honderd jaar geleden leefden. ‘Die zag het toch wel aankomen, die was niet bang voor een robot.’ (Lachend) Ik wil eigenlijk over honderd jaar leven om te zien dat ik nu al gelijk heb. Nabokov of Rushdie? Nabokov. Reve of Wolkers? Reve. Tolstoj of Dostojevski? Tolstoj. Haruki Murakami of Philip Roth? Roth. Camus of Houellebecq? Houellebecq! Dat is een man die mij in alles eigenlijk vreemd is, maar die mij toch heel onrustig maakt. Hij zegt akelige dingen, maar heeft niet altijd ongelijk. Een goede verkenner van de menselijke zwakheid.",9578,geert de groot wat het leukste tijden het schrijven van uw laatste boek ik vind het schrijven altijd leuk dan kan ik vreemd genoeg de wereld aan

423380026,"Terroristerna halshögg också spädbarn med sina bara händer. De slaktade hela familjer, våldtog kvinnor och tog barn och åldringar som gisslan. Islamisterna skändade lik och livesände övergreppen – på offrens egna sociala medier, för deras när och kära att titta på. Grymheterna borde göra varje empatisk människa illamående. CNN:s mångåriga korrespondent Nic Robertson kunde knappt hålla tillbaka tårarna när han rapporterade från brottsplatserna i Israel. I skrivande stund har drygt 1 200 personer berövats livet på ett bestialiskt vis, men man finner hela tider fler lik. Samtidigt skanderar ett tusental Palestina-anhängare i Sydney . Vid Harvard hävdade 34 studentorganisationer i lördags att Israel bär hela skulden för den våldsamma terrorn. I Kristianstad, Malmö och Helsingborg slöt svensk-palestinier upp bakom det palestinska 'upproret'. Vi ser alltså ett öppet, ogenerat stöd i hela västvärlden för fasansfulla grymheter, utförda av en terrororganisation som styr över drygt två miljoner människor i diktaturen Gaza. Det är kväljande. Man kan ha olika uppfattningar om vad kriget beror på, och hur det ska lösas. Men det borde inte vara svårt att ta kraftigt avstånd från den terrorism och antisemitism vi har sett de senaste dagarna. Tack och lov gjorde också samtliga partiledare detta i söndagens tv-debatt. Men. Under veckan har såväl Magdalena Andersson som Nooshi Dadgostar kritiserats hårt av sina egna. Lokalpolitiker för S avsäger sig alla uppdrag i protest mot Anderssons ord om att terrorn är oacceptabel. Kommentarsfälten till hennes inlägg på Instagram är nedlusat av hån och hat från vänsterhåll. Malmös kommunstyrelseordförande Katrin Stjernfeldt-Jammeh (S) presterar bara en ynkligt svagt kommentar på Facebook efter att hundratals bilar med Palestinaflaggor tutat glatt efter lördagens våldsyttring. Den socialdemokratiska riksdagsledamoten Jamal El-Hajs oförmåga och ovilja att ta avstånd från Hamas grymheter i en Expressen-artikel (10/10) är häpnadsväckande, men S-ledningen verkar inte orka ta honom i örat på grund av krav på radikalisering från hans stora väljarskara i Malmö. IVänsterpartiet har folkvalda företrädare öppet krävt Dadgostars avgång för hennes 'svek' att ta avstånd från Hamas attack. Partiets mörka antidemokratiska historia borde också vara väl känd. Detta bidrar till ett allvarligt hot mot svenska judar. De uppmanas nu att inte skylta med sin identitet, synagogor tvingas öka säkerheten och judiska förskolor ställer in utomhusaktiviteter. Det säger mycket om hur utbrett judehatet är i vårt land. Särskilt inom vänstern och extremhögern. Det är förstås alldeles uppåt väggarna att en grupp svenskar inte kan känna sig säkra när de ser firande av Hamas blodiga terror mot judar på svenska gator. Alla – jag understryker alla – har i dessa dagar ett ansvar att inte vara tyst när antisemitismens och islamismens fula trynen dyker upp. På sociala medier, i skolan, bland vänner, på jobbet.",9578,terroristerna halshögg också spädbarn med sina bara händer de slaktade hela familjer våldtog kvinnor och tog barn och åldringar som gisslan islamisterna skändade lik och livesände övergreppen på offren egna sociala medier för deras när och kära att titta på grymheterna borde göra varje empatisk människa illamående cnn s mångåriga korrespondent nic robertson kunde knappt hålla tillbaka tårarna när han rapporterade från brottsplatserna israel skrivande stund har drygt personer berövat livet på ett bestialiskt vis man man finner hela tider fler lik samtidigt skanderar ett tusental palestina anhängare sydney vid harvard hävdade studentorganisationer lördag att israel bär hela skulden för den våldsamma terrorn kristianstad malmö och helsingborg slöt svensk palestinier upp bakom det palestinska upproret vi ser alltså ett öppet ogenerat stöd hela västvärlden för fasansfulla grymheter utförda av en terrororganisation som styr över drygt två miljoner människor diktaturen gaza det är kväljande man kan ha olika uppfattningar om vad kriget beror på och hur det ska lösas man det borde inte vara svårt att ta kraftigt avstånd från den terrorism och antisemitism vi har sett de senaste dagarna tack och lov gjorde också samtliga partiledare detta söndagen tv debatt man veckan har såväl magdalena andersson som nooshi dadgostar kritiserat hårt av sina egna lokalpolitiker för s avsäger sig alla uppdrag protest mot anderssons ord om att terrorn är oacceptabel kommentarsfälten till hennes inlägg på instagram är nedlusat av hån och hat från vänsterhåll malmös kommunstyrelseordförande katrin stjernfeldt jammeh s presterar bara en ynkligt svagt kommentar på facebook efter att hundratal bilar med palestinaflaggor tutat glatt efter lördagen våldsyttre den socialdemokratiska riksdagsledamoten jamal el hajs oförmåga och ovilja att ta avstånd från hamas grymheter en expressen artikel är häpnadsväckande man s ledningen verkar inte orka ta honom örat på grund av krav på radikalisere från hans stora väljarskara malmö ivänsterpartiet har folkvalda företrädare öppet krävt dadgostars avgång för hennes svek att ta avstånd från hamas attack partiet mörka antidemokratiska historia borde också vara väl känd detta bidrar till ett allvarligt hot mot svenska judar de uppmanas nu att inte skylta med sin identitet synagogor tvingas öka säkerheten och judiska förskolor ställer utomhusaktiviteter det säg mycket om hur utbrett judehatet är vårt land särskilt inom vänstern och extremhögern det är förstås alldeles uppåt väggarna att en grupp svenskar inte kan känna sig säkra när de ser firande av hamas blodiga terror mot judar på svenska gator alla jag understryker alla har dessa dagar ett ansvar att inte vara tyst när antisemitismens och islamismen fula trynen dyker upp på sociala medier skolan bland vänner på jobbet
423380202,"'We definitely do see a slight change compared to the total population, we do see a slight pullback in overall basket,' Furner said in an interview with Bloomberg . 'Just less units, slightly less calories.' The comments resulted in dozens of news articles. Shares in Walmart and other snack-makers fell on the news.

But speaking to Morgan Stanley analysts, Walmart has clarified 'two potential misconceptions,' the analysts wrote. The group of customers taking this drug that Walmart can track is small, the analysts note. But, within this group, Walmart observed these customers were spending slightly less on food year over year. But 'their overall spend is higher, even excluding the cost of the drug,' the analysts wrote based on conversations with Walmart. Increased spending is coming from categories like lifestyle, fitness, and 'medications to relieve side effects of the drug.'

like nausea and diarrhea. In aggregate, GLP-1 spending changes are not moving the needle for Walmart's total business, the authors write.

Of course, this doesn't mean the drugs won't be a headwind for Walmart or other retailers in the long run. But reports may have missed 'the broader point that customer engagement with Walmart appears to be increasing after taking GLP-1 drugs,' the analysts wrote. Meanwhile, Walmart's US CEO hasn't been the only exec discussing Ozempic and fueling the frenzied attention around the impacts these drugs could have on companies that sell food to consumers. The buzzy drugs have been mentioned by the CEO of Kellanova, manufacturer of Cheez-It, Pringles, and Rice Krispies Treats, and Smucker's CEO, too. Both executives

they're monitoring research. And not unlike AI becoming the buzzword of choice in tech earnings calls this year, data from Alphasense showed mentions of 'Ozempic' in consumer product earning calls, company documents, and related news have gone up 228% in the last 90 days.

423374168,"Nächtlicher Einsatz: Mit dem Rettungshubschrauber muss ein verunglückter Amerikaner in der Nacht vom Gratweg geborgen werden. © Bergwacht Füssen. Der spätsommerliche Herbst hält die Einsatzkräfte der Füssener Bergwacht mächtig auf Trab: Teilweise mehrmals am Tag und in der Nacht müssen die Helfer ausrücken. Schwangau/Füssen - Der bislang sommerliche Oktober lockt ungebrochen viele Wanderer auf den Tegelberg und ins Umland. Die Füssener Bergwacht muss deshalb teilweise mehrmals am Tag und auch in der Nacht ausrücken. Wie die Bergretter heute mitteilten, erfolgte die erste Alarmierung gleich am 1. Oktober. Einsatzort war der Gratweg am Tegelberg, wo eine erschöpfte amerikanische Touristin am Ende ihrer Kräfte war. Die bodengebundene Rettung dauerte bis in die Dunkelheit. Tags darauf verletzten sich zeitgleich zwei Bergwanderer am Sprunggelenk und mussten vor dem Transport ins Krankenhaus medizinisch versorgt werden. Gleich vier Einsätze mussten die Einsatzkräfte am Feiertag, 3. Oktober, absolvieren. Zunächst musste ein Fünfjähriger versorgt werden, der bei einem Radsturz eine Kopfverletzung erlitt und anschließend über Übelkeit klagte. Der nächste Einsatz war eine Wirbelsäulenverletzung nach einem Sturz nahe der Rohrkopfhütte. Während der Versorgung des Verletzten meldete eine Touristenfamilie einen Angehörige auf dem Berg als vermisst, da dieser seit mehreren Stunden nicht mehr erreichbar war. Nach einer halben Stunde meldete sich der Vermisste jedoch bei seiner glücklichen Familie. Den Abschluss an diesem Tag war die Versorgung und Bergung einer Dame mit Schädel-Hirn-Trauma und weiteren Verletzungen am Südufer des Weißensees. Als Transportmittel für den Notarzt und die Patientin unterstütze die Wasserwacht Weißensee mit einem Boot die Rettungsaktion. Besonders schlimm erwischte es auch am vergangenen Sonntag einen jungen Bergsteiger, der mit Hilfe des Rettungshubschraubers „RK2' in einer nächtlichen Rettungsaktion polytraumatisiert vom Gratweg des Tegelberg in die Unfallklinik Murnau geflogen werden musste. Am gestrigen Dienstag mussten die Bergretter erneut zeitgleich zu zwei Einsätzen ausrücken.

Frank Smyth, embajador de Irlanda en España (tercero por la izquierda) y Jesús Julio Carnero, alcalde de la Valladolid (a la derecha), durante el homenaje. NACHO GALLEGO (EFE) El presidente de la asociación hispanoirlandesa de Valladolid, Carlos Burgos, narra las aventuras del guerrero. El héroe nació en Lifford (Irlanda) y murió en el cercano Simancas (Valladolid), cuyo archivo recuerda la relación de O’Donnell con Felipe III, a quienes pidió socorro contra la invasión inglesa sobre Irlanda. Todo comenzó, indica Burgos, con unas obras en la calle de la Constitución en 2020, aprovechadas para excavar donde antaño estuvo la capilla de las Maravillas del inmenso convento de San Francisco, el lugar en el que el irlandés pidió ser enterrado y en el que 100 años antes fue sepultado Cristóbal Colón. Localizaron 20 cuerpos, pero ninguno se correspondió con él. 'No sabemos a ciencia cierta dónde estarán sus restos. Dado el personaje, levantó una curiosidad internacional tremenda y una gran campaña informativa sobre Valladolid, salió en 60 grandes medios internacionales', celebra el coordinador de la asociación. 'Hemos recibido cartas del ministro de Exteriores de Irlanda de agradecimiento y de muchos irlandeses en Estados Unidos, vienen irlandeses a Valladolid y piden consejo a la asociación para ver la placa conmemorativa o el archivo de Simancas', añade Burgos, feliz por 'hermanar dos pueblos en época de conflictos'. Tras la pandemia, el Ayuntamiento anterior (PSOE y Valladolid Toma La Palabra) colocó una placa en honor a Red Hugh en esa misma calle tras celebrar en 2022 el primer recorrido público del féretro. También se inició una conexión con Irlanda al nombrarlo país invitado en el festival de cine Seminci, la feria del libro o festivales folclóricos. El nuevo gobierno local, de PP con Vox, ha mantenido el festejo, sostiene la concejala de Turismo, Blanca Jiménez (PP), para 'generar nuevos hitos de interés': 'Este traspasa fronteras y tiene potencial para abrir una vía con Irlanda, queremos que un acontecimiento histórico se convierta en un atractivo cultural y turístico y atraer a público irlandés'.

'Su historia es de persecución. Al darle cobijo en un momento muy difícil en la historia de Irlanda, España mostró gran generosidad, hay mucha gratitud en Irlanda hacia esa herencia compartida', valora, y ensalza a Carlos Burgos como 'enlace moderno hacia una historia larga y profunda'.

423374532,"Daniel Sancho, escoltado por la policía tailandesa en el puerto de la isla Koh Samui, en Tailandia, de camino a los juzgados. (EFE/Somkeat Ruksaman) El pasado 7 de octubre se cumplían dos meses del ingreso en prisión de Daniel Sancho por el asesinato de Edwin Arrieta . El hijo de Rodolfo Sancho permanece en la cárcel de Koh Samui a la espera de ser juzgado por el crimen y, hasta ahora, no había trascendido ninguna fotografía o vídeo del joven en el interior del centro penitenciario. Sin embargo, el programa TardeAR ha conseguido este miércoles las primeras imágenes del chef en la cárcel. Tal y como ha desvelado el formato presentado por Ana Rosa Quintana, Sancho luce un aspecto muy distinto al de la última vez que se le vio, hace más de dos meses, cuando recreaba el crimen confeso esposado y escoltado por la policía tailandesa, con bermudas rosas y camiseta negra. Te puede interesar: Así fueron los encuentros de Daniel Sancho y Edwin Arrieta en Madrid: el testimonio de la mejor amiga del cirujano El aspecto corpulento y la melena rubia del joven han dado paso ahora a un cuerpo más delgado y una cabeza completamente rapada , tal y como se aprecia en el vídeo que ha conseguido el periodista Alejandro Rodríguez. Las imágenes fueron tomadas este martes 10 de octubre y en ellas se observa cómo un funcionario de prisiones le indica a Daniel, que lleva el uniforme de la prisión y la acreditación que le identifica, que tiene una videollamada. Al principio, solo se ve el tronco y los brazos del preso, que gesticula en señal de desaprobación. Finalmente, Sancho se sienta frente a la cámara y, tras la mascarilla que lleva puesta por protocolo de la prisión, se puede ver su mirada ojerosa y su cabeza rapada. El nieto de Sancho Gracia observa la pantalla del ordenador y acaba colgando la llamada.

Por ejemplo, en México, el costo promedio del nuevo iPhone 15 ronda los $1,000 dólares (el modelo más sencillo), algo que para la mayoría significa un verdadero lujo y muchas semanas de arduas semanas y grandes sacrificios. Es por ello que muchos creadores de contenido se aprovecha de la situación y salen a las calles para generar concursos que puedan subir a las redes y que les genere monetización, ofreciendo a los participantes atractivas recompensas, como lo son buenas sumas de dinero o teléfonos celulares. Recientemente, se ha vuelto viral una de estas competencias organizadas por un usuario de TikTok de México, la cual no tuvo un final feliz. El usuario @hotspanishmx lanzó un reto a 3 jóvenes mujeres que consistía en que debían raparse por completo la cabeza y luego, debían sacar un papelito de un frasco, en donde había 3 de distintos colores, ya que uno otorgaría un iPhone 15, otro dinero y el tercero nada. En el video se puede ver el momento en el que las chicas se someten a la sesión de peluquería, en donde perdieron por completo su melena para, luego, sacar el papelito del frasco. La afortunada que sacó el papel de color negro fue la ganadora del iPhone 15, mientras que la que sacó el de color rojo se llevó el dinero en efectivo, mientras que la que no se llevó nada, pese al sacrificio que hizo con su melena, no pudo ocultar su tristeza y decepción por su mala suerte, rompiendo en llanto frente a todos. La gente que se encontraba en el lugar se compadeció de ella y de repente, apareció un hombre, el cual se supo era su pareja, quien la abrazó e intentó consolarla. Los clips de este reto por un iPhone 15 superan los 27 millones de reproducciones y decenas de comentarios, en donde la gente mostró su inconformidad al considerar que lo hecho con estas mujeres fue un verdadero acto de crueldad y que todas merecían ser ganadoras del teléfono de Apple por lo que se animaron a hacer.",9578,hoy en día sobre todo las nuevas generacione están dispuesta hacer de todo con tal de obtener algunos gadget siendo uno de los más deseados el nuevo iphone el cual tiene un costo algo elevado para que los jóvenes puedan comprar por ellos mismos por ejemplo en méxico el costo promedio del nuevo iphone ronda los dólare el modelo más sencillo algo que para la mayoría significa un verdadero lujo y muchas semanas de arduas semanas y grande sacrificio es por ello que muchos creadores de contenido se aprovecha de la situación y salen las calle para generar concursos que puedan subir las rede y que les genere monetización ofreciendo los participantes atractivas recompensas como lo son buenas sumas de dinero o teléfono celulare recientemente se ha vuelto viral una de estas competencias organizadas por un usuario de tiktok de méxico la cual tuvo un final feliz el usuario lanzó un reto jóvene mujere que consistía en que debían raparse por completo la cabeza y luego debían sacar un papelito de un frasco en donde había de distintos colore ya que uno otorgaría un iphone otro dinero y el tercero nada en el video se puede ver el momento en el que las chicas se someten la sesión de peluquería en donde perdieron por completo su melena para luego sacar el papelito del frasco la afortunada que sacó el papel de color negro fue la ganadora del iphone mientras que la que sacó el de color rojo se llevó el dinero en efectivo mientras que la que se llevó nada pese al sacrificio que hizo con su melena pudo ocultar su tristeza y decepción por su mala suerte rompiendo en llanto frente todo la gente que se encontraba en el lugar se compadeció de ella y de repente apareció un hombre el cual se supo era su pareja quien la abrazó e intentó consolarla los clip de este reto por un iphone superan los millone de reproduccione y decenas de comentario en donde la gente mostró su inconformidad al considerar que lo hecho con estas mujere fue un verdadero acto de crueldad y que toda merecían ser ganadoras del teléfono de apple por lo que se animaron hacer
423369587,"O gosto ruim frequente na boca é causado por diversas razões, dentre as principais estão problemas dentários, que podem ser tanto infecções como cáries, doença periodontal e, até mesmo, restaurações antigas que estão com infiltrações. E não só: infecções orais, como a candidíase ou bacterianas também entram nesta lista de possíveis gatilhos para o mau hálito. Para além das questões odontológicas, distúrbios gastrointestinais, como refluxo gastroesofágico, gastrite e úlceras, podem provocar regurgitação de ácido estomacal, resultando no gosto amargo na boca. O quadro pode ser agravado, ainda, pelo uso de medicamentos que alteram o paladar, ampliando as possíveis causas do mau hálito. E há outros fatores, como alterações hormonais, infecções sistêmicas, alimentação inadequada, desidratação e doenças como o diabetes e o câncer. Para começo de conversa, a higiene bucal adequada desempenha um papel fundamental na prevenção do incômodo. 'A remoção de bactérias por meio da escovação dos dentes e da língua, além do uso do fio dental são medidas essenciais', afirma o Dr. Fábio Azevedo, Cirurgião Dentista e Consultor do Departamento de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento (P&D) da S.I.N. Implant System. 'É assim que conseguimos combater a placa bacteriana, eliminar a saburra lingual e, também, afastar problemas dentários como cáries e doenças gengivais', explica. Além da higiene oral, adotar medidas de autocuidado também podem minimizar a halitose. Uma das condutas mais importantes é manter-se hidratado, tomando pelo menos dois litros de água por dia e, ainda, adotar uma alimentação equilibrada. E é importante, também, evitar o cigarro já que o fumo contribui para a redução da quantidade de saliva, causando desconforto e favorecendo o acúmulo de bactérias que causam gosto ruim na boca. Se tudo isso for feito à risca, e, mesmo assim, o odor desagradável persistir, o melhor a fazer é buscar ajuda profissional. Médico e Dentista irão fazer uma avaliação detalhada e indicar o tratamento adequado. Lembre-se que livrar-se do gosto ruim persistente na boca passa essencialmente pelo diagnóstico preciso da causa do problema, que pode ser multifatorial. É importante compreender que, embora existam medidas imediatas para proporcionar alívio temporário, é necessário buscar orientação e ter constância no acompanhamento com profissionais de saúde.",9578,o gosto ruim frequente na boca é causado por diversas razões dentre principais estão problemas dentário que podem ser tanto infecções como cárie doença periodontal e até mesmo restaurações antigas que estão com infiltraçõe e não só infecções orais como candidíase ou bacterianas também entram nesta lista de possíveis gatilhos para o mau hálito para além das questões odontológicas distúrbios gastrointestinais como refluxo gastroesofágico gastrite e úlcera podem provocar regurgitação de ácido estomacal resultando gosto amargo na boca o quadro pode ser agravado ainda pelo uso de medicamentos que alteram o paladar ampliando possíveis causa mau hálito e há outros fatore como alterações hormonais infecções sistêmicas alimentação inadequada desidratação e doenças como o diabetes e o câncer para começo de conversa higiene bucal adequada desempenha um papel fundamental na prevenção incômodo remoção de bactérias por meio da escovação do dent e da língua além uso fio dental são medidas essenciais afirma o fábio azevedo cirurgião dentista e consultor departamento de pesquisa e desenvolvimento da implant system é assim que conseguimos combater placa bacteriana eliminar saburra lingual e também afastar problemas dentários como cárie e doenças gengivais explica além da higiene oral adotar medidas de autocuidado também podem minimizar halitose uma das condutas mais importantes é manter se hidratado tomando pelo menos dois litros de água por dia e ainda adotar uma alimentação equilibrada e é importante também evitar o cigarro já que o fumo contribui para redução da quantidade de saliva causando desconforto e favorecendo o acúmulo de bactérias que causam gosto ruim na boca se tudo isso feito à risca e mesmo assim o odor desagradável persistir o melhor fazer é buscar ajuda profissional médico e dentista irão fazer uma avaliação detalhada e indicar o tratamento adequado lembre se que livrar se gosto ruim persistente na boca passa essencialmente pelo diagnóstico preciso da causa problema que pode ser multifatorial é importante compreender que embora existam medidas imediata para proporcionar alívio temporário é necessário buscar orientação e ter constância acompanhamento com profissionais de saúde

423364260,"La microbiota, es decir, los microorganismos que habitan en el intestino humano son actores clave en multitud de funciones fisiológicas, incluyendo la inmunidad, el metabolismo, la inflamación, aspectos de la salud mental y la salud de los huesos. Microbiota alterada y huesos débiles. Un reciente estudio liderado por científicos de la Universidad de Harvard ha revelado una nueva conexión entre el microbioma intestinal y un componente crucial de la salud humana: la densidad y fortaleza de los huesos. Este estudio, publicado en Frontiers of Endocrinology, ha identificado asociaciones notables entre ciertas bacterias y el estado de los huesos. Uno de los hallazgos es que una microbiota de gran volumen, sobrecrecida, se asocia con menor densidad ósea y alteraciones en la microarquitectura interna de los huesos. Ambos son factores de riesgo para desarrollar osteoporosis y sufrir fracturas u otras lesiones.  Este estudio es considerado como la observación más amplia realizada hasta la fecha que explora la posible relación entre las bacterias intestinales y la salud ósea utilizando tecnologías de imagen de alta resolución (para observar los huesos), junto con la secuenciación genética de las heces (para determinar la composición de la microbiota intestinal). Los investigadores pudieron establecer relaciones positivas y negativas entre varios tipos de bacterias y el estado de los huesos. Por ejemplo, se descubrieron asociaciones negativas con la cantidad de bacterias denominadas Akkermansia y Clostridiales DTU089. Otras investigaciones habían vinculado las Akkermansia con la obesidad y las Clostridiales DTU089 con una menor actividad física y una ingesta reducida de proteínas, características que, a su vez, están relacionadas con una salud ósea deficiente. Los investigadores observaron que en las asociaciones negativas la densidad de los huesos era inferior a la deseable y, en cambio, su tamaño era grande. Esto sugiere que determinadas bacterias y la alimentación favorecen el crecimiento óseo a expensas de la densidad, sobre todo a medida que una persona envejece. Es importante tener en cuenta que este estudio no demuestra que los microorganismos intestinales sean la causa directa de los huesos más fuertes o más débiles. Es posible que tanto la composición de la microbiota como el estado de los huesos estén influenciados por la dieta y los hábitos. Por otra parte, la dietista-nutricionista Martina Ferrer explica en que cuidar la microbiota con una dieta rica en alimentos prebióticos (hortalizas, legumbres y cereales integrales) y probióticos (alimentos fermentados sin pasteurizar) favorece el crecimiento de la bacterias intestinales beneficiosas que mejoran la absorción del calcio y, por tanto, el buen estado de los huesos. Microbiota e inmunidad. Otro trabajo de la Universidad de Harvard publicado en la revista Nature arroja luz sobre la relación entre las bacterias intestinales y la inmunidad. Los autores muestran que las bacterias que se alimentan de ácido linoleico y lo convierten en ácido linoleico conjugado (CLA) favorecen una respuesta inmunitaria eficaz a las infecciones digestivas. Los hallazgos del equipo de Harvard describen una intrincada interacción entre los microbios intestinales, los alimentos y la inmunidad.  Microbiota y metabolismo. Se sabe que el microbioma influye en el desarrollo de la obesidad y enfermedades metabólicas como la diabetes, pero las formas específicas en que afecta el metabolismo son difíciles de descifrar. El intestino contiene tantas especies de bacterias que producen diferentes tipos de metabolitos que desentrañar sus efectos es muy complicado. Una investigación dirigida por el doctor Sloan Devlin, profesor de química biológica y farmacología molecular en la Facultad de Medicina de Harvard, ha ayudado a profundizar en el conocimiento de las relaciones entre la microbiota y el metabolismo. En concreto, ha descubierto que la eliminación de un solo gen en una cepa común de bacterias intestinales provocó cambios significativos en el metabolismo y redujo el aumento de peso en los ratones. El análisis genético reveló que además de las alteraciones relacionadas con el metabolismo, había cambios en los genes que controlaban el ritmo circadiano y la respuesta inmunitaria. Esto sugiere que las alteraciones de los ácidos biliares inducidas por bacterias pueden causar una gama amplia de cambios en el huésped. Microbiota e inflamación. Los ácidos biliares producidos por el hígado son conocidos desde hace mucho tiempo por su papel fundamental a la hora de ayudar a absorber los alimentos que ingerimos. Pero, según una serie de estudios de la Universidad de Harvard, estas sustancias que disuelven grasas y vitaminas también desempeñan un papel importante en la inflamación intestinal, porque regulan la actividad de células inmunitarias clave relacionadas con una variedad de afecciones inflamatorias del intestino, como como colitis ulcerosa y enfermedad de Crohn. Microbiota y salud mental. La microbiota intestinal utiliza las mismas sustancias químicas y células que el cerebro para funcionar. Además, el intestino y el cerebro están en constante comunicación. Cuando vemos algo sabroso, el cerebro le indica al intestino mediante mensajeros químciso que se prepare para la comida entrante. Y cuando nos sentimos ansiosos o estresados, podemos experimentarlos como dolor abdominal, diarrea, náuseas o 'mariposas'. Los científicos de Harvard investigan cómo los millones de bacterias en el intestino interactúan con el sistema nervioso entérico y con el sistema nervioso central.

423361212,"A colon-targeted delivery system that can efficiently deliver and release quercetin is essential to improve its bioavailability. We previously found that hydrophobic ethyl cellulose (EC) nanofibers could efficiently deliver quercetin to colon, but the release of quercetin was limited. To address this problem, hydrophilic gelatin (GN) was used as a regulator, and quercetin-loaded nanofibers with different mass ratios of EC to GN (3:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3) were fabricated by electrospinning. All nanofibers had a cylindrical morphology and high encapsulation efficiency (over 94 %), and there existed molecular interactions among quercetin, EC, and GN. The high GN content reduced the thermal stability of nanofibers but increased their surface wettability. Besides, these nanofibers had good stability in acidic and aqueous foods. Importantly, the release of quercetin in the simulated gastrointestinal fluid was <3 %.

423352039,"La forte puzza di gas , l’allarme che suona e la corsa in cortile. Questo è quello che è successo nella mattinata di mercoledì in una scuola di Milano , situata in via Natta, quartiere Lampugnano. L’istituto in questione è la scuola superiore Gerolamo Cardano che comprende il liceo delle scienze umane, il liceo scientifico, il liceo sportivo e l’istituto tecnico con indirizzo “Amministrazione, finanza e marketing”. Tutto è iniziato intorno alle 11:30 della mattinata, quando tutti gli allievi si trovavano nelle rispettive aule a seguire le lezioni. Alcuni insegnanti e inservienti scolastici stavano attraversando i corridoi dell’edificio, finché non hanno sentito un odore sgradevole propagarsi per tutto l’ambiente. Inizialmente, la puzza non è stata associata al gas perché non era così forte e si pensava che fosse qualcosa di passeggero. Poco dopo, la puzza di metano si sarebbe fatta più persistente e, non capendo da dove potesse provenire, la dirigenza scolastica ha deciso di dare luogo a un’ evacuazione . Tutti e 500 gli studenti dell’istituto sono stati fatti uscire dalle aule, sospendendo le attività di lezione, e in modo ordinato sono stati condotti nel cortile del complesso scolastico. Mentre gli alunni si dirigevano negli spazi aperti, sono stati contattati i vigili del fuoco del comando provinciale di Milano che si sono recati, poco dopo, in via Natta, per poi essere raggiunti anche dai poliziotti della questura. Nonostante le procedure di evacuazione siano avvenute in tempi brevi e in modo ordinato, otto studenti hanno manifestato i sintomi di una lieve intossicazione da monossido di carbonio come mal di testa, nausea, vomito e debolezza. Quattro degli otto che erano intossicati si sono ripresi nell’arco di poco tempo, mentre altri quattro hanno continuato a manifestare una sorta di stato confusionale per cui è stato necessario l’intervento degli operatori del 118 . I quattro ragazzi sono stati poi trasportati al pronto soccorso dell’ospedale Sacco e dell’ospedale San Carlo in codice verde. I vigili del fuoco hanno esplorato l’istituto per cercare dove fosse collocata la spaccatura che ha causato la perdita di metano ma hanno presto compreso che la fonte andasse cercata al di fuori del complesso, dato che al suo interno non risultava niente di anomalo. Dopo aver perlustrato la zona circostante la scuola, i vigili del fuoco hanno potuto constatare che la fuga avesse avuto origine in un cantiere non distante dal Gerolamo Cardano. Gli operai, mentre erano impegnati a lavorare, hanno inavvertitamente perforato una tubazione da cui è fuoriuscito il gas che ha raggiunto le finestre dell’edificio scolastico. Intorno alle 13, appurata la fonte della fuga, gli studenti e gli insegnanti hanno potuto tornare nelle aule e riprendere le loro attività perché all’interno della scuola non si era formata nessuna sacca di gas.",9578,la forte puzza di gas che suona e la corsa cortile questo è quello che è successo nella mattinata di mercoledì una scuola di milano situata natta quartiere lampugnano questione è la scuola superiore gerolamo cardano che comprende il liceo delle scienze umane il liceo scientifico il liceo sportivo e tecnico con indirizzo amministrazione finanza e marketing tutto è iniziato intorno alle della mattinata quando tutti gli allievi si trovavano nelle rispettive aule seguire le lezioni alcuni insegnanti e inservienti scolastici stavano attraversando corridoi finché non hanno sentito un odore sgradevole propagarsi tutto inizialmente la puzza non è stata associata al gas perché non era così forte e si pensava che fosse qualcosa di passeggero poco dopo la puzza di metano si sarebbe fatta più persistente e non capendo da dove potesse provenire la dirigenza scolastica ha deciso di dare luogo un evacuazione tutti e gli studenti sono stati fatti uscire dalle aule sospendendo le attività di lezione e modo ordinato sono stati condotti nel cortile del complesso scolastico mentre gli alunni si dirigevano negli spazi aperti sono stati contattati vigili del fuoco del comando provinciale di milano che si sono recati poco dopo natta poi essere raggiunti anche dai poliziotti della questura nonostante le procedure di evacuazione siano avvenute tempi brevi e modo ordinato otto studenti hanno manifestato sintomi di una lieve intossicazione da monossido di carbonio come mal di testa nausea vomito e debolezza quattro degli otto che erano intossicati si sono ripresi di poco tempo mentre altri quattro hanno continuato manifestare una sorta di stato confusionale cui è stato necessario degli operatori del quattro ragazzi sono stati poi trasportati al pronto soccorso sacco e san carlo codice verde vigili del fuoco hanno esplorato cercare dove fosse collocata la spaccatura che ha causato la perdita di metano ma hanno presto compreso che la fonte andasse cercata al di fuori del complesso dato che al suo interno non risultava niente di anomalo dopo aver perlustrato la zona circostante la scuola vigili del fuoco hanno potuto constatare che la fuga avesse avuto origine un cantiere non distante dal gerolamo cardano gli operai mentre erano impegnati lavorare hanno inavvertitamente perforato una tubazione da cui è fuoriuscito il gas che ha raggiunto le finestre scolastico intorno alle appurata la fonte della fuga gli studenti e gli insegnanti hanno potuto tornare nelle aule e riprendere le loro attività perché della scuola non si era formata nessuna sacca di gas
423351876,"We're all protective of the ones that we love, and rarely does this show up more than in the parent-child relationship . Having children can feel as though your heart exists outside your body, and it can make you feel completely out of control when bad things happen to them that you're unable to do anything about. For one woman, she was left furious when her daughter was attacked at school by another pupil and left with a nosebleed, and then later was instructed by the school to exchange apologies with the boy. The unnamed woman tried to get further information about how the school were dealing with the boy who attacked her daughter, but the school , she claimed, was bound by GDPR not to give it to her, which only seemed to enhance her frustration over the difficult situation. The woman, who took to Netmums looking for advice on her dilemma, explained that the incident had taken place after one of her daughter's friends informed her daughter than one boy had pushed her. Her daughter then questioned the boy if this was the case, but the woman noted that she believed her daughter 'shouldn't have got involved'. The boy then 'called her all manner of obscenities before stabbing her with his compass in her arm (apparently this was an accident). She pushed him off. 'He called her a few more choice words and she turned her back to ignore him. He said something else, as she turned around and he sucker punched her square in the face causing a massive nosebleed (ie blood all over her hands, arms, down her legs where she bent forward etc).' The woman was then called by the school, who requested she came to collect her daughter, where she was 'met by head of year seven who says it's very serious and filling in suspension paperwork. [I was] confused as I had no idea what had happened, confirmed it was against the boy who did this to her and not her being suspended.' She went on to explain that initially she 'put [her] trust in school to deal with' the incident, but quickly felt let down by them when it turned out the boy wasn't going to suspended for his violent behaviour towards her daughter after all. The year head rang the woman's husband and said that they had spoken to both children about the incident and their daughter was 'happy with the outcome', when her husband asked for further detail, the school were unable to provide it because of GDPR regulations, but said if their daughter wasn't happy or wanted to change classes to move away from the boy she could, but they couldn't move the boy into another class. Later her daughter explained that she had been asked to apologise because she had 'pushed him off'. The woman took this up with both the deputy head and head of school, both of whom couldn't provide much further information, but assured her the matter had been dealt with. 'We're completely new to the school. We're still kinda to the area. We don't know this child. We don't know what the stages of consequences are. How do we know where it lies? How serious is it for them? Do we trust our child won't be attacked again?!?! Is it normal for them to not tell you ANYTHING!?' the woman detailed. 'We know it was assault and we could contact police, we don't feel we want to this. As far as we are aware, there's no SEN for the boy. Obviously some anger issues and he needs some help learning how to behave appropriately, nurturing etc. I get all of that. But to not know anything of a consequence that the school is doing is really hard.' She went on to claim that her daughter was now facing threats and teasing from other pupils, who are 'telling her to do stuff or they'll punch her like he did'. Most of the commenters supported the woman, and advised her to take further action, with some even recommending that she go to the police. 'I would contact the police,' wrote one. 'He won't have anything permanently damaging on record due to his age but it will hopefully teach him right from wrong and consequences. Punching someone isn't a minor incident and schools only care about protecting the reputation on the school. If there are no consequences he can feel free to use violence whenever he wants and God forbid it escalates.' Another advised that the woman 'make sure all conversations, even if done over the phone, are confirmed via email - all black and white conversations count for more. I would ask the school why was she made to apologise, as all she did was defend herself. As bad as it sounds keep pestering them as they'll know you aren't a pushover and won't be dismissed or brushed off'. Do you have a story to sell?

423352388,"In an expansive international collaboration, doctors from across the globe sought to evaluate a new medication aimed at managing type 2 diabetes, a health condition characterized by elevated sugar levels in the blood. Dr. Vanita R. Aroda from a Boston hospital spearheaded this extensive test, which unfolded across 14 countries and involved 177 different locations. Exploring New Avenues: The Essence of the Study. Diabetes, especially type 2, inherently involves managing and often struggling with higher blood sugar levels. A common method to gauge this involves checking a metric known as HbA1c, representing the average blood sugar over about three months. The study focused on individuals with an HbA1c level ranging from 8.0 to 10.5 percent, alongside adhering to certain body weight parameters, and who were already administering 1 to 3 glucose-lowering tablets daily. These selected individuals were introduced to a new medication, semaglutide, and tasked with taking it daily. Three varying doses – 14 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg – were administered. Participants were divided into three groups, with each group receiving a distinct dosage for a duration of 68 weeks. The primary objective revolved around assessing whether the medication could substantially reduce the HbA1c level within a year. Unveiling Findings: Did the Medicine Work? A year into the study, it was discerned that all three doses of semaglutide succeeded in diminishing the HbA1c level, albeit with differing efficacy. The 25 mg and 50 mg dosages showcased superior results compared to the 14 mg dosage, highlighting that the intensity of the HbA1c reduction was positively correlated with the medication dose. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to acknowledge that some participants experienced side effects, predominantly gastrointestinal issues, which were generally mild and notably more prevalent in the groups taking the 25 mg and 50 mg dosages. Breaking it Down: What Does This Mean? To distill the findings: for individuals grappling with type 2 diabetes, administering a daily dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg of semaglutide was discernibly more effective than the 14 mg dosage in reducing their blood sugar levels. However, it’s paramount to bear in mind that a higher dosage, while more efficacious in managing blood sugar, might also elevate the risk of experiencing mild stomach issues. The leading figures of the study further articulated that the 25 mg and 50 mg dosages not only adeptly regulated blood sugar but also assisted participants in shedding some weight. The meticulous details of the study are available in The Lancet for those interested in probing deeper into the scientific particulars of the research. Diabetes remains a subject of extensive research, with various studies globally exploring new medications, treatment methodologies, and additional facets such as metabolic syndrome. Similarly, widespread research into health is continually shedding light on diverse areas, from the exploration of maintaining regular blood sugar levels in diabetics to the potential role of Vitamin E in averting conditions like Parkinson’s disease. Navigating through the myriad of healthcare information and research, especially concerning prevalent conditions like diabetes, enhances our collective understanding and propels us toward refined, more effective approaches in managing and potentially alleviating such health challenges in the future.

423352710,"A colon-targeted delivery system that can efficiently deliver and release quercetin is essential to improve its bioavailability. We previously found that hydrophobic ethyl cellulose (EC) nanofibers could efficiently deliver quercetin to colon, but the release of quercetin was limited. To address this problem, hydrophilic gelatin (GN) was used as a regulator, and quercetin-loaded nanofibers with different mass ratios of EC to GN (3:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3) were fabricated by electrospinning. All nanofibers had a cylindrical morphology and high encapsulation efficiency (over 94 %), and there existed molecular interactions among quercetin, EC, and GN. The high GN content reduced the thermal stability of nanofibers but increased their surface wettability. Besides, these nanofibers had good stability in acidic and aqueous foods. Importantly, the release of quercetin in the simulated gastrointestinal fluid was <3 %. The addition of GN was beneficial to the release of quercetin in colon, and nanofibers with EC to GN being 1:3 had a more preferable release performance. The anticancer activity of nanofibers against HCT-116 cells was proved by inhibiting cell viability through the induction of apoptosis.

423400646,"By Yoo Jee-ho. SEOUL, Oct. 12 (Yonhap) -- South Korean golfer An Byeong-hun has been suspended by the PGA Tour for three months for violating the organization's anti-doping policy. The tour announced Wednesday (U.S. local time) that An had tested positive for a substance prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency contained in a cough medicine available over the counter in his native country. The suspension is retroactive to Aug. 31, 2023, and An is eligible to return to competition on Dec. 1, 2023. 'He has cooperated fully with the Tour throughout the process and accepted his suspension,' the PGA Tour said in a statement posted on its website, adding that it will have no further comment on the suspension at this time. An released a statement on his Instagram page, saying he should have been more careful with his choice of medication. 'In August, I was suffering from a head cold and cough. As my symptoms worsened, my mother suggested I take a widely available medication from Korea that had helped her through a similar ailment,' An wrote. 'I took this medicine without checking its contests first, only to later find that it contained a substance that is prohibited under the PGA Tour's anti-doping program. It was the only time I used this medication and in no way did I take it to gain a competitive advantage. 'I regret not being more thorough in my decision-making and take full responsibility for my actions,' An continued. 'I'd like to thank the PGA Tour for supporting me during this process and look forward to returning to competition in the new year.' An, 32, is the son of two 1988 Olympic table tennis medalists: Ahn Jae-hyung of South Korea and Jiao Zhimin of China. An represented South Korea at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

423400329,"Microsoft today revealed the IRS last month sent the Windows maker a bill for $28.9 billion in back taxes – and has vowed to contest the charge. The demand was disclosed in an SEC filing . We're told that US tax collectors sent the bill on September 26 in the form of a notice of proposed adjustments (NOPAs) for Microsoft’s activities in the tax years 2004-2013. 'The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing,' the filing stated. Transfer pricing is the practice of setting prices for goods and services exchanged within a company. More specifically, the IRS describes it as 'prices charged by one affiliate to another, in an intercompany transaction involving the transfer of goods, services, or intangibles, yield results that are consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances.' Transfer pricing is legal, though when it sees revenue shifted to low-tax jurisdictions it can be considered abusive. In 2020 ProPublica detailed Microsoft’s sale of assets to a tiny corporation in Puerto Rico, a territory that gave the software giant a tiny tax rate described as 'nearly zero percent.' Moving its assets to Puerto Rico meant around $39 billion in profits weren’t taxed at the level that other jurisdictions levy, it's claimed. The IRS has been concerned about Microsoft’s practices since at least 2014, when the software giant was sued for not coughing up documents related to a tax probe. Microsoft’s filing states it can cover the demand if it decides to pay up. The announcement did not appear to affect Redmond's share price. 'We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months,' the filing stated. A Microsoft blog post appended to the filing, but not posted to Microsoft.com at the time of writing, sees Daniel Goff, corporate vice president for worldwide tax and customs argue 'our subsidiaries shared in the costs of developing certain intellectual property, under those IRS cost-sharing regulations, the subsidiaries were also entitled to the related profits.' ®",9578,microsoft today reveal irs month send windows maker bill billion taxis vow contest charge demand disclose sec filing tell tax collector send bill september form notice propose adjustment nopas microsoft activity tax year primary issue nopas relate intercompany transfer pricing filing state transfer pricing practice set price good service exchange company specifically irs describe price charge affiliate intercompany transaction involve transfer good service intangible yield result consistent result realize uncontrolled taxpayer engage transaction circumstance transfer pricing legal see revenue shift low tax jurisdiction consider abusive propublica detail microsoft sale asset tiny corporation puerto rico territory give software giant tiny tax rate describe nearly zero percent move asset puerto rico mean billion profit tax level jurisdiction levy claim irs concern microsoft practice software giant sue cough document relate tax probe microsoft filing state cover demand decide pay announcement appear affect redmond share price disagree propose adjustment vigorously contest nopas irs administrative appeal office necessary judicial proceeding expect final resolution issue month filing state microsoft blog post append filing post time writing see daniel goff corporate vice president worldwide tax customs argue subsidiary share cost develop certain intellectual property irs cost sharing regulation subsidiary entitle relate profit
423399990,"Diana de Concilies fue perdiendo cabello, hasta que un día despertó sin un cabello. El doctor que la trató le informó que sufría de alopecia y que solo tenía una opción real: aprender a vivir con ello. Entonces tomó una decisión, no solo aprendió a vivir con ello, sino que se convirtió en una experta en pelucas. Lleva 40 años en este mundo y 18 apoyando a Senosalud como experta en el tema. «Con el tiempo aprendí que lo que tenemos encima no da la felicidad, te da la tranquilidad de verte bonita. Pero la felicidad te la das tu misma y yo aprendí a ser feliz» expresó Concilies. Quien no ha vivido esta experiencia, tal vez piense que perder el cabello no es un gran trauma. Pero para los pacientes oncológicos sí lo es. Muchos, cuando se ven al espejo, no solo ven la ausencia de algo que antes crecía de manera natural, sino que la imagen les recuerda diariamente que sufren una enfermedad. La pérdida de autoestima y la tristeza que genera esa imagen puede tener un impacto en la propia recuperación. Por eso muchas empresas se unen para que mujeres que se quedan sin cabello, obtengan una peluca. Y eso fue lo que sucedió en el evento 'Juntos por una vida color rosa', que se realizó el pasado 7 de octubre. Se trata de la segunda edición, organizado por Bellisima Express junto con Rotaract, con el apoyo de Nestlé, American Perfect y Senosalud. La misión fue recibir a personas que quisieran donar su cabello para la fabricación de pelucas que serán entregadas a pacientes oncológicos. No es una empresa sencilla: se necesitan más de 10 a 15 colas de cabello humano para terminar una peluca. Así lo informó Alcira Garantón Lopez, voluntaria de Senosalud y sobreviviente de cáncer de mama. 'Senosalud son los encargados de hacer las pelucas y las donan a las personas que las necesitan', explica Juliana Ceballos, propietaria de Bellisima Express. Ella aseveró que en la primera edición recolectaron más de 67 coletas, que se transformaron en 16 pelucas, este año afortunadamente la cifra aumentó: recibieron 120 coletas. ¿Qué te motiva a donar? 'Hace 5 años fui diagnosticada con cáncer de mama y empecé una travesía de lo que era el sufrir cuando se te cae el pelo, pero ahora Dios me ha dado la oportunidad de tener una melena abundante y vine a donar mi cabello', comentó Marisol Mosquera sobreviviente al cáncer. Expresó que los llamados «eventos rosa» son dedicados a enseñarle a la mujer que el ser diagnosticada no se trata de un decreto de muerte sino un diagnóstico para aprender a apreciar la vida. Para Gabriela Guillen, miembro de Rotaract y que ha estado en contacto con muchas pacientes oncológicas y supervivientes, donar su cabello es lo mínimo que puede hacer por ellas. El mes de prevención del cáncer de mama. Además de esta donación, hay más eventos en camino. El 26 de octubre se realizará por segundo año consecutivo el desfile rosa en el Centro Comercial Cerro Verde, una pasarela donde participan pacientes oncológicas de diferentes edades, que modelan atuendos de marcas reconocidas. Para Karelys Pieruzzi, una de las más grandes enseñanzas que ha recibido de las pacientes sucedió en el desfile cuando una paciente, el día anterior ,había recibido una quimioterapia y como consecuencua se sentía muy mal. Cuando le preguntaron a la modelo si no quería desfilar, respondió: 'Yo estoy aquí por esto, nací para esto.

423395862,"Sammanfattning : N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is an organic solvent widely used in the industry. Irritation of the eyes and in the respiratory system has been reported after occupational exposure to low air levels of NMP. The EU has also classified it as a developmental toxicant. NMP is easily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and airways and through skin. Sammanfattning : There is a huge lack of dermal uptake data for chemicals, and it is frequent with large variations in reported permeability coefficients for chemicals with more than one data set, showing the need for a new and standardized in vitro method. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop the new method of measuring dermal absorption of chemical vapor using the TGA method. Sammanfattning : A major part of this thesis work has been research in a medical project, where, together with industry and clinical partners, the aim was to develop a prototype system for non-invasive monitoring of premature babies based on the optical measurement technique gas in scattering media absorption spectroscopy (GASMAS). Part of the project was to develop a 3D-printed tissue phantom based on chest X-ray images of the thorax of a premature infant. Sammanfattning : Do metal particles (including particles of pure metals, alloys, metal oxides and compounds) pose a hazard or risk to human health? In the light of this question, this thesis summarizes results from research conducted on metal particles, and describes the elaboration and implementation of an in vitro test methodology to study metal release from particles through corrosion and dissolution processes in synthetic biological media relevant for human exposure through inhalation/ingestion and dermal contact.

423395120,"En el camino hacia la maternidad, las mujeres embarazadas a menudo se enfrentan a una serie de inquietudes y preguntas relacionadas con su salud y la del bebé en desarrollo. Entre estas preocupaciones, una de las cuestiones que ha generado cierta controversia es sobre si una mujer embarazada puede comer picante. En este artículo exploraremos a fondo esta cuestión para brindar a las futuras madres información sólida y basada en la ciencia sobre si pueden o no disfrutar de la comida picante durante esta etapa. En resumen Consumir alimentos picantes de manera moderada durante el embarazo generalmente no representa un riesgo para la salud de la madre ni para el desarrollo del bebé; Es importante desmitificar las creencias populares infundadas que atribuyen a los alimentos picantes la capacidad de cambiar la apariencia física del bebé. Combinar alimentos picantes con una dieta equilibrada rica en nutrientes es esencial para garantizar que tanto la madre como el bebé reciban los nutrientes necesarios para un desarrollo saludable. ¿Una mujer embarazada puede comer picante? La cuestión de si una mujer embarazada puede consumir alimentos picantes es un tema que suele generar preocupación. En general, se considera seguro que las mujeres embarazadas disfruten de alimentos picantes en su dieta , siempre y cuando lo hagan con moderación y tengan en cuenta algunas precauciones. Sin embargo, es importante recordar que cada embarazo es único y que los cambios hormonales pueden influir en las preferencias alimenticias y las tolerancias individuales. En primer lugar, hay que señalar que, en términos generales, los componentes activos de los alimentos picantes, como la capsaicina presente en los chiles, no se han asociado directamente con riesgos para el desarrollo fetal. Sin embargo, durante el embarazo, muchas mujeres experimentan cambios en su sentido del gusto y su capacidad para tolerar ciertos alimentos . Por lo tanto, lo que solía ser agradable antes del embarazo podría volverse menos apetitoso o incluso provocar sensaciones desagradables al gusto. Cada embarazo es único, y lo que funciona para una mujer puede no ser adecuado para otra. En consecuencia, es fundamental que las mujeres embarazadas escuchen a sus cuerpos y se adapten a sus propias necesidades y preferencias. Si una mujer embarazada solía disfrutar de alimentos picantes antes del embarazo y ahora encuentra que le provocan malestar, no hay nada de malo en evitarlos temporalmente. Efectos de la comida picante en el embarazo. La ingestión de alimentos picantes durante el embarazo puede tener diversos efectos que varían de una persona a otra. Si bien no existe una regla universal que se aplique a todas las mujeres embarazadas, algunos efectos pueden manifestarse en el transcurso de esta etapa tan importante. A continuación, se explorarán algunos de estos efectos: Efectos en el bebé. Consumir alimentos picantes durante el embarazo no tiene ningún efecto en la apariencia física del bebé , como cambiar su tez, hacer que su cabello sea rizado o aumentar la cantidad de pelo. Estas creencias populares carecen de evidencia científica y no tienen fundamento médico. Los rasgos físicos de un bebé están determinados principalmente por su ADN, que hereda de sus padres. Los alimentos picantes, por otro lado, no tienen la capacidad de alterar la genética del bebé en desarrollo . Por lo tanto, es esencial comprender que lo que una madre come durante el embarazo no afecta de manera significativa la apariencia física de su hijo. En lugar de preocuparse por cambios en la apariencia del bebé, es más importante enfocarse en llevar una dieta equilibrada y saludable durante el embarazo para garantizar el bienestar tanto de la madre como del feto. Por otro lado, existen estudios que sugieren que el exponer al feto a alimentos nuevos puede incrementar la posibilidad de que el bebé se aventure a probar nuevos sabores cuando sea grande. Efectos en la mamá. La ingestión de alimentos picantes durante el embarazo puede tener varios efectos en la madre, siendo uno de los más notables la posibilidad de experimentar molestias gastrointestinales. Debido a que las mujeres embarazadas a menudo tienen una mayor sensibilidad en áreas como el estómago, es posible que consumir alimentos picantes ocasionalmente pueda desencadenar síntomas como acidez estomacal, indigestión o incluso gastritis. Sin embargo, es importante destacar que no todas las mujeres embarazadas experimentan estas molestias , y su aparición no es tan común como se podría pensar. Además de las posibles molestias gastrointestinales, algunas mujeres embarazadas pueden experimentar un aumento temporal en las náuseas o las ganas de vomitar después de consumir alimentos picantes. Esto puede deberse a la intensidad de los sabores y olores de los alimentos picantes, que pueden ser más pronunciados durante el embarazo debido a los cambios hormonales. Es importante recordar que estas reacciones pueden variar ampliamente de una mujer a otra, y no todas las embarazadas experimentarán estos síntomas. Por otro lado, se ha evidenciado que algunos alimentos picantes pueden contribuir a una disminución del colesterol en mujeres embarazadas. Precauciones a tener en cuenta si va a comer picante en el embarazo. Cuando una mujer embarazada decide incluir alimentos picantes en su dieta, es importante tomar algunas precauciones para garantizar su bienestar y el del bebé en desarrollo. Aquí hay algunas indicaciones clave a tener en cuenta: Moderación en la alimentación: se aconseja a las embarazadas que controlen la cantidad de alimentos picantes que consumen para evitar posibles molestias gastrointestinales y mantener un equilibrio en su dieta. Atender las señales corporales: se les sugiere prestar atención a las señales que su cuerpo les envía. En caso de malestar o acidez estomacal después de ingerir alimentos picantes, se recomienda considerar una reducción en el consumo. Diversificación nutricional: es importante resaltar la necesidad de diversificar la dieta durante el embarazo, combinando alimentos picantes con otras opciones ricas en nutrientes para garantizar un aporte adecuado de vitaminas y minerales esenciales. Mantener la hidratación: es muy importante mantener una hidratación adecuada, ya que los alimentos picantes pueden aumentar la sensación de sed. Riesgos de comer mucho picante en el embarazo. El consumo de alimentos picantes puede añadir sabor y emoción a las comidas. Pero, durante el embarazo es importante ser consciente de los posibles riesgos asociados con el exceso de picante en la dieta. A continuación, se presentan algunos de los riesgos de consumir demasiada comida picante: Posibles Posible aumento en la sed. Potencial irritación del tracto digestivo. Conclusión.

Estas creencias carecen de base científica y pueden generar preocupaciones innecesarias en las futuras madres. En lugar de preocuparse por mitos infundados, las mujeres embarazadas deben enfocarse en llevar una dieta equilibrada, rica en nutrientes esenciales para el crecimiento y desarrollo del bebé. Preguntas frecuentes ¿Qué pasa si como picante en el embarazo?

423391195,"'We were then approached by his manager to see if it was something we’d look at.' The Swans pulled off the deal without much fuss, coughing up Pick 33 in exchange. It was a huge day for the Swans, who moved on former No. 5 draft pick Dylan Stephens to the Roos, while The revelation that Adams first approached the Swans has raised eyebrows and footy journalist Jon Ralph believes Adams may have seen 'the writing on the wall' after being pushed out of the starting midfield and being moved to the half-back line. 'I think there was a fair element of him saying to his good mate Brodie Grundy, ‘look you’re going to Sydney; I can see what’s going to happen the next couple of years for me, I’d love to go to Sydney as well’,' he said on Fox Footy’s Trading Day. '(Sydney) don’t need these guys forever. I get the feeling after the last couple of days, Taylor could see the writing on the wall. Play one more year, and be surplus to (Collingwood’s) requirements.' Adams on Wednesday night dropped an emotional video thanking teammates, staff, mentors and fans. 'Hey everyone. Crazy morning this morning. Emotions running high,' he said in a video shared by Collingwood on Instagram. 'Clearly mixed emotions at the moment. I just want to send a message out just to thank everyone involved in the Collingwood Football Club for what has been an incredible journey. 'Ten years ago, I walked into the doors as a 20-year-old kid with no real purpose or direction. I’ve just been supported through the ups and the downs. I’ve been given the opportunity to thrive in an environment where giving your best was always appreciated and supported and encouraged.' Adams singled out former president Eddie McGuire, former captain Nick Maxwell, former coach Nathan Buckley, teammates Steele Sidebottom and Jeremy Howe as well as premiership coach Craig McRae, Magpies footy boss Graham Wright and captain Darcy Moore. 'There’s just so many people that this organisation have made my life so much more enjoyable and I’ll get to those individually,' he said. 'A few shout outs. Obviously, Eddie McGuire for everything that he did for our football club and for the friendship that I’ve still got with him today. 'To Maxy and Bucks for their leadership and support through the early years to Pendles for outlasting everyone and just being a great mate. 'Steele and Howie, still two of the best friends that I’ve made through football and two guys that I have ultimate respect for and I’m going to miss you guys both so much. 'To Fly, Wrighty and Darce. What a journey the last couple of years have been. Darce, our friendship has just gone stronger and stronger and stronger over the last six years and to see you hold that cup up this year is one of my proudest moments in my career. To all my current teammates, I absolutely love our playing group. The last couple years have been some of the most enjoyable times I’ve had in my football career. 'Making this decision is one of the hardest decisions I’ve made and it’s purely because of the people I get to work with day in day out.' He also addressed his devastation at missing out on playing in the club’s Grand Final win. 'Clearly I would have rather been out there, but the next best thing was sitting amongst you all and being able to see the emotion that this football club brings to you and that’s certainly reciprocated to us as players on the field,' he said to fans. 'I’ll see you at the SCG next year.' The Swans have been the most active team in the Trade Period so far, already securing James Jordon and Joel Hamling. Swans footy boss Charlie Gardiner said he was surprised both deals for Adams and Grundy got done so early, but had no doubt the duo would help keep the club in finals contention. 'Things moved quicker than we might have expected overnight and today,' he said on Trading Day. 'Terrific outcome for the club to bring in two experienced and high quality players.

The maximum heat index is likely to occur during the early afternoons. Sensitive groups: While extreme heat can put everyone at risk for heat illnesses, health risks are greatest for the elderly, young children, people with chronic illnesses such as breathing difficulties, heart conditions or psychiatric illnesses, people who work or who exercise in the heat, homeless people and low-income earners. Potential Health implications: Heat illnesses, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat illnesses can lead to long-term health problems and heat stroke can lead to death. Caution: If any symptoms of heat illness are present (such as dizziness or fainting, nausea or vomiting, headache, rapid breathing and heartbeat, or extreme thirst) immediately move to a cool place and drink liquids; water is best. The most dangerous heat illness is heat stroke, with symptoms that include complete or partial loss of consciousness or confusion and high body temperature. If caring for someone with those symptoms, call 911 immediately. While waiting for help, cool the person right away by moving them to a cool place, applying cold water to large areas of the skin or clothing and fanning the person as much as possible. Everyone should stay alert and take precautions – stay cool and hydrated. Check on vulnerable family members, friends and neighbours. Those who take medication or have a health condition should ask their doctor if it increases their health risk in the heat and follow their recommendation.

423381842,"Virtual reality (VR) is becoming more popular in corporate offices, thanks in part to the rise of remote work in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. VR headsets offer many potential employee benefits, from a more private and customizable virtual office to more engaging training sessions. According to Deloitte , by 2025, around 70 percent of employee training will include a VR headset. But this increase in virtual training is already driving up the number of hours employees wear a headset, causing many experts to become concerned about VR's potential pitfalls — particularly when it comes to our physical health. How Do VR Headsets Work? When it comes to the workplace, employees have the opportunity to engage in workplace simulations that might otherwise be cost-prohibitive, hazardous or unfeasible to replicate in conventional settings. By donning a VR headset, personnel or trainees can immerse themselves in diverse workplace scenarios. Are VR Headsets Bad for You? Like any technology, VR headsets can have potentially negative effects if used improperly or excessively. Researchers are increasingly worried that more time spent in a VR headset will exacerbate the symptoms shorter headset times already cause, like nausea, disorientation ( cybersickness ) and other issues such as neck and shoulder strain. Alexis Souchet, a cognitive ergonomicist at the University of Southern California, says that it's important to inform the general public that hardware and software providers do little to asses the long-term risks of using VR. 'We don't have enough information on the risks for users to deploy these technologies at work within the five coming years,' says Souchet. In short, while an employee may feel more motivated or energized in their customized space while plugged into a VR headset, it may come at the cost of their physical health. How Are Companies Adopting VR? While VR headsets first became popular due to video games, their usefulness is quickly evolving to fit company needs . Businesses like Toyota, Delta Airlines, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and BMW are already testing the effectiveness of VR in employee training for soft skills like leadership and teamwork. These skills can be hard to come by. For example, a 2021 Harvard Business Review article found that 89 percent of executives had difficulty hiring individuals with soft skills, forcing many companies to train their employees in these fields. In years past, businesses may have relied on online modules to teach employees project management or collaboration techniques. Now, many have turned to VR to get the job done, which may be more effective. Read More: Scientists Are Trying to Give Robots Social Skills What Are The Benefits of VR Training? The benefits of VR training include completing training modules faster and a heightened emotional attachment to the material. In a recent survey on VR employee training, researchers found that employees progressed through the training modules four times faster than in-person and 1.5 times faster than online. Additionally, the employees felt they had a stronger emotional connection to the lesson content, four times more than in-person courses and twice as much as learning online. These findings suggest that VR can save companies significant employee training time. 'It's living in the age of capitalism,' says Jens Grubert, a professor at Coburg University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Germany. 'Companies do that because they want to save money, period.' However, these companies may unknowingly jeopardize their employees’ health when trying to cut costs. Are VR Headsets Bad For Your Eyes? Using VR headsets may cause you to experience eye strain or cyber sickness. When using a VR headset, the pixelated screen is close to your eyes, which can tire out eye muscles, causing eye strain. Though most VR headset companies ensure their product’s ergonomic design and comfort, there can still be issues with long sessions of headset use. 'With the current generation headset, the viewer experiences something similar to a 3D film; your eyes focus on a certain distance but converge on a different distance, which is unnatural,' Grubert says. 'This can lead to cybersickness and to different side effects. That's something the current generation displays don't address well.' Unfortunately, most studies on VR’s health-related side effects only look at usage under an hour. To address this knowledge gap, Grubert and his team had 16 individuals wear a VR headset for a full 40-hour workweek, then repeat the same conditions, minus the headset, for a second week. published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics in 2022 was one of the first to look at the long-term effects of VR. The results revealed a concerning level of cybersickness, and two of the participants had to drop out after day one due to migraines, anxiety and nausea. 'In our study, we observed that most people did not prefer VR for long-term use, but they were open to it,' says Snehanjali Kalamkar, a research associate at Coburg University. 'What the general public should be more aware of these, I wouldn't call it a disadvantage, but these limitations of VR that they're not aware of at the moment.' How to Use VR Responsibly. While the results from the 2022 study proved concerning, Grubert and his team believe that VR can still be used in a long-term setting, just more 'I would say you shouldn’t use it for the whole week all the time,' adds Verena Biener, a Ph.D. student at Coburg University and the study’s first author. 'But maybe for specific tasks for shorter periods, where you benefit from the VR, like using special tools that are only possible in VR.' The researchers hope that their study can inspire other needed long-term VR studies and VR companies to promote more sustainable VR usage. 'Limiting your use time to under 30 minutes is the easiest way,' adds Souchet, who recommends frequent breaks to avoid headaches and eye strain. 'I would advise not to rush into using VR if your company didn't base its adoption on a rational assessment of the benefits and the risks by considering workers’ health and safety.'",9578,virtual reality vr popular corporate office thank rise remote work aftermath pandemic vr headset offer potential employee benefit private customizable virtual office engaging training session accord deloitte percent employee training include vr headset increase virtual training drive number hour employee wear headset cause expert concerned vr potential pitfall particularly come physical health vr headsets work come workplace employee opportunity engage workplace simulation cost prohibitive hazardous unfeasible replicate conventional setting don vr headset personnel trainee immerse diverse workplace scenario vr headsets bad like technology vr headset potentially negative effect improperly excessively researcher increasingly worried time spend vr headset exacerbate symptom short headset time cause like nausea disorientation cybersickness issue neck shoulder strain alexis souchet cognitive ergonomicist university southern california say important inform general public hardware software provider little asse long term risk vr information risk user deploy technology work come year say souchet short employee feel motivated energize customize space plug vr headset come cost physical health company adopt vr vr headset popular video game usefulness quickly evolve fit company need business like toyota delta airlines johnson johnson bmw test effectiveness vr employee training soft skill like leadership teamwork skill hard come example harvard business review article find percent executive difficulty hire individual soft skill force company train employee field year past business rely online module teach employee project management collaboration technique turn vr job effective read scientist try robot social skills benefit vr training benefit vr training include complete training module fast heighten emotional attachment material recent survey vr employee training researcher find employee progress training module time fast person time fast online additionally employee feel strong emotional connection lesson content time person course twice learn online finding suggest vr save company significant employee training time live age capitalism say jens grubert professor coburg university applied sciences arts germany company want save money period company unknowingly jeopardize employee health try cut cost vr headsets bad eye vr headset cause experience eye strain cyber sickness vr headset pixelated screen close eye tire eye muscle cause eye strain vr headset company ensure product ergonomic design comfort issue long session headset use current generation headset viewer experience similar film eye focus certain distance converge different distance unnatural grubert say lead cybersickness different effect current generation display address unfortunately study vr health relate effect look usage hour address knowledge gap grubert team individual wear vr headset hour workweek repeat condition minus headset second week publish ieee transactions visualization computer graphics look long term effect vr result reveal concern level cybersickness participant drop day migraine anxiety nausea study observe people prefer vr long term use open say snehanjali kalamkar research associate coburg university general public aware disadvantage limitation vr aware moment use vr responsibly result study prove concern grubert team believe vr long term setting use week time add verena biener student coburg university study author maybe specific task short period benefit vr like special tool possible vr researcher hope study inspire need long term vr study vr company promote sustainable vr usage limit use time minute easy way add souchet recommend frequent break avoid headache eye strain advise rush vr company base adoption rational assessment benefit risk consider worker health safety

423380546,"Bottomless brunches are banned in a large number of states. According to data from the National Institutes of Health, 24 states, including Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania, prohibit restaurants and bars from offering unlimited drinks for a set price or time. Still, both awareness and enforcement can be spotty, and some eateries have found workarounds. Servers and staff at restaurants have long groused about the ill behaviour of brunchers determined to wring the most out of mimosa deals. On Reddit, a thread for venting waitstaff titled 'bottomless mimosas can go to hell' documented stories of bubbly-fueled nightmare patrons who squat at tables for hours. On other anonymous forums, servers admit to watering down the drinks of imbibers, swapping in sparkling water for wine – confirming the suspicions of many critics of the bottomless-brunch phenomenon. 'People get so messy with bottomless drinks, especially early-20s kids and the dreaded mimosa moms,' one server wrote. Of course, servers are often trained to watch out for clearly intoxicated customers – in some cases by state-mandated programs – but in the chaos of a brunch service, particularly if tables are being served with carafes or bottles, would-be sick diners can be difficult to spot. While they are relatively rare in restaurants, vomit fees are common in taxis and car services. But those are not without controversy. Uber’s policy states that riders are charged a cleaning fee that is 'assessed and charged according to the extent of damage.' Lyft has a similar policy and says typical fees for pukers range from $40 to $150. But some riders have complained they were charged for messes they didn’t make in what some reports called 'vomit fraud.' Will the micro-trend of making brunch customers pay up for throwing up catch on more broadly? California is often a vanguard for cultural trends, from farm-to-table dining to legal marijuana. And no doubt that would be welcome to restaurant staff as a deterrent to overindulging guests. Or restaurants wanting to avoid such messy scenarios could simply … keep the bottom on those bottles?",9578,bottomless brunch ban large number state accord datum national institutes health state include texas virginia pennsylvania prohibit restaurant bar offer unlimited drink set price time awareness enforcement spotty eatery find workaround server staff restaurant long grouse ill behaviour bruncher determined wring mimosa deal reddit thread vent waitstaff title bottomless mimosa hell document story bubbly fuel nightmare patron squat table hour anonymous forum server admit water drink imbiber swap sparkle water wine confirm suspicion critic bottomless brunch phenomenon people messy bottomless drink especially kid dreaded mimosa mom server write course server train watch clearly intoxicate customer case state mandate program chaos brunch service particularly table serve carafe bottle sick diner difficult spot relatively rare restaurant vomit fee common taxi car service controversy uber policy state rider charge cleaning fee assessed charge accord extent damage lyft similar policy say typical fee puker range rider complain charge mess report call vomit fraud micro trend make brunch customer pay throw catch broadly california vanguard cultural trend farm table dining legal marijuana doubt welcome restaurant staff deterrent overindulge guest restaurant want avoid messy scenario simply bottle

423335328,"Infant malnutrition in Darfur has burgeoned due to worsening conflict in Sudan. However, the nonprofit organization Kids for Kids has made strides in combating these health concerns with a goat loan microfinance scheme. The Ongoing Crisis in Darfur: Basics In recent months, Sudan’s western region of Darfur has been embroiled in ongoing civil conflict. For the last two decades, the area has been restive and is currently suffering from ongoing military rivalries. Perhaps the most striking implication of the hostilities is an unprecedented refugee crisis , which has displaced up to 1.5 million Sudanese civilians. Continued volatility on the ground has deprived the Darfur region of essential aid and support. One of the most pressing issues facing refugees is that of child malnutrition. UNICEF has estimated that 3.4 million children under the age of 5 are suffering from acute malnutrition in Sudan. This number has accelerated sharply since conflict broke out earlier this year. With food shortages limiting daily meals, aid workers have noted a reduction in women’s breast milk as a result. A lack of breast milk can be detrimental to the growth and brain development of infants. While there are around 1,500 U.N.-based nutrition sites across Sudan, a relatively small proportion of these in Darfur means that infant malnutrition can go undetected. Kids for Kids Goat Loan Scheme Since 2001, Kids for Kids (KFK) has been working to provide solutions for malnutrition in Darfur. One project undertaken by the group has not only shown great promise on the ground but has influenced other aid groups and public figures to follow suit. It has been regarded as one of the best microfinance schemes to date. After seeing firsthand the effects of malnutrition in Darfur, KFK CEO Patricia Parker implemented a goat loan scheme. Goat milk is often the only source of nutrition for infants and children in Darfur, and is relied upon heavily by families in the region. In order to sustain the poorest households in KFK-adopted villages, five nanny goats are loaned to the poorest 15% of communities over a two-year period . After this time, during which a shared billy goat helps to breed a flock of kids, nanny goats are passed to another family in need. Encouraging Science. Milk from the flock serves as a vital source of protein for babies and young children. Health professionals have advocated the use of goat milk in combating infant malnutrition in recent years. that goat milk proteins are more easily digested than cow milk and can minimize symptoms of abdominal illness. This in turn prevents further malnutrition from diseases such as dysentery and parasitic infections. Moreover, goat milk has been shown to provide higher “satiating effects” in infants thus reducing prolonged hunger. Commitment to Goat Breeding. Goat husbandry combats infant malnutrition in Darfur while also remaining an integral source of household income . It is particularly apposite in small, developing communities owing to low-cost, low-feed requirements. Goats are able to survive on dried twigs and leaves and can find sustenance in arid climates. Excess milk can also be sold to the rest of the community for profit. As such, KFK has robust measures in place to ensure that goat flocks continue to alleviate poverty and starvation at a community level. Husbandry training is provided to educate families about harmful plants and disease prevention. KFK has also introduced an Animal Loan Committee and a Children’s Shepherds’ Committee. The former oversees animal care on a weekly basis, while the latter educates children on raising goats. This is particularly important as children in Darfur are often tasked with caring for flocks. As many as 310,000 Darfuri civilians across 70 villages are currently benefiting from KFK’s work. The success of the Goat Loan Scheme has resulted in further projects involving chicken and donkey husbandry. The Ongoing Influence of KFK The success of KFK has influenced celebrities and other notables to take action against infant malnutrition in Darfur. These include British celebrities such as Joanna Lumley, Miriam Margolyes and Timothy West. Locally, the Wali (governor) of northern Darfur has started his own goat loan project based on the successes of the organization.

По словам звезды, концерты пришлось отменить в связи с затянувшимся бронхитом и рекомендацией пульмонолога. В доказательство Дима приложил фото, сделанное в больнице возле процедурного кабинета. «Сейчас я под его наблюдением! Переезды и перелеты могут сильно усугубить ситуацию. Поэтому, чтоб не рисковать — я вынужден остаться в Москве и в спокойной обстановке идти на поправку», — написал в своем блоге Дима. При этом, певец отметил, что о новых датах перенесенных концертов он сообщит чуть позже. А будущие выступления в Омске, Новосибирске, Томске, Ташкенте, Астане и Алматы пройдут по графику, который указан в афише.

Ascolta ora: 'Allergia all'acqua, come è possibile? Cos'è l'orticaria acquagenica, i sintomi e le cure' Allergia all'acqua, come è possibile? Cos'è l'orticaria acquagenica, i sintomi e le cure Le cronache recenti che arrivano da oltreoceano, precisamente dalla California, ci hanno raccontato di una rarissima malattia che affligge una ragazza di 25 anni, Tessa Hansen-Smith, che soffre di orticaria acquagenica : si tratta dell'allergia all' acqua , fonte di vita primaria per tutti gli essere umani assieme all'aria. Di cosa si tratta. , tutte le volte che la giovane va a contatto con l'acqua subisce importanti conseguenze alla pelle (eruzioni cutanee) e perfino ferite. Attualmente questa patologia affligge meno di 250 persone in tutto il mondo ed è conosciuta con il nome di orticaria per le reazioni che il derma subisce. Le cause non sono ancora note nonostante sia presente in letteratura scientifica dal 1964. Tessa ha delle reazioni quando beve e suda ma anche quando mangia alimenti che contengono l'acqua visti che le provocano bruciori allo stomaco. Le cause. Nonostante i progressi della medicina, le cause sono ancora ignote ma le ipotesi numerose: come spiegano gli esperti , tra queste c'è l'analogia con l'orticaria colinergica che si manifesta 'c on un aumento della temperatura corporea tale da attivare il riflesso della sudorazione'. Altre teorie propendono per un'allergene o una sostanza chimica presente nell'acqua che scatena la reazione ma anche la reazione con sostanze delle pelle, ad oggi sconosciute, che ' rilasciano l'istamina dai mastociti e la formazione di un'eruzione cutanea orticariode I sintomi. Come accennato, la sintomatologia principale si verifica con: arrossamento della pelle; eritema cutaneo; intenso prurito; rigonfiamenti (ponfi) della grandezza compresa tra 1 e 3 millimetri; bruciore e formicolìo. Qualsiasi liquido acquoso, anche se si viene a contatto con la neve ad esempio, provoca gli stessi sintomi. Il problema principale è quando si deve bere o fare la doccia anche se nel primo caso, per fortuna, il fastidio risulterebbe di minore entità. ' Il fastidio si manifesta sulla pelle, dopo un contatto prolungato come una doccia o un bagno. Poi la gravità dei sintomi può variare da lieve a grave, ma non ci sono controindicazioni a livelli alimentari ', ha spiegato a laRepubblica il prof. Pietro Quaglino, Direttore della Clinica dermatologica dell'Università di Torino, che ha avuto a che fare con casi simili a quelli di Tessa. Come si cura. Di solito, la sintomatologia tende a migliorare e scomparire dopo un periodo compreso fra trenta minuti e un massimo di due ore dopo essere entrati a contatti con l'acqua. I segni sulla pelle, però sono destinati a rimanere anche per molte ore. ' Dopo aver fatto i test dermatologici e tutte le prove allergiche, le terapie prevedono l'utilizzo di antistaminici o di cortisone. Esistono poi dei casi più gravi che possono sviluppare edemi agli occhi o alle labbra, e anche sintomi respiratori come l'asma. E se il cortisone non basta si possono prescrivere anche degli immunosoppressori. Ma nella maggior parte dei casi la regressione è di carattere spontaneo ', conclude il prof. Quaglino. Secondo gli ultimi studi, la patologia si può manifestare a qualsiasi età anche se a esserne maggiormente coinvolti sono i ragazzi giovani: a scatenarla, poi, anche eventuali predisposizione genetiche.

423369223,"À Tinqueux, près de Reims, Vanessa nous a ouvert les portes de sa maison remplie de moisissure, où elle vit avec son mari et ses six enfants. Une famille excédée et triste. En France, 450 000 logements seront considérés comme indignes. Ça va faire cinq ans que Vanessa, son mari et leurs six enfants vivent dans un pavillon de 83m² rempli de moisissures, à Tinqueux, près de Reims. Tapisserie qui tombe, odeur d’humidité, champignons sur les murs… Voilà trois ans que leur quotidien est devenu un véritable cauchemar, quand Vanessa a vu les premiers signes de moisissure dans une des pièces. Aujourd’hui, toute la famille dort dans une même chambre. 'Je ne peux pas inviter mes amis' À cause de l'humidité, ses enfants ont développé des problèmes de santé. Notamment son plus jeune, Tyméo, 9 ans. Son asthme a 'évolué depuis qu'on est ici' et est devenue sévère. 'Mes autres enfants font pareil. Ils font souvent des bronchites asthmatiques suite à l'humidité, les champignons qu'on respire. Ils sont tout le temps sous traitement', témoigne la maman.

Pour les six enfants, le quotidien est devenu difficile à la maison. 'Je ne peux pas inviter mes amis ou même fêter mon anniversaire' , souligne Noah, 13 ans, l’aîné de la fratrie. Il confie au quotidien avoir du mal à trouver son intimité. La maman confirme. 'Moi-même, je refuse d'inviter leurs copains, je n'ai pas envie qu'ils voient ma maison comme ça et qu'ils aient des problèmes à l'école. Les deux garçons manquent souvent l’école à cause de leur toux. Tyméo, 9 ans, a déjà été hospitalisé plusieurs jours de suite. L a mère de famille a perdu de nombreuses vêtements à cause de l'humidité, dont tout son stock taille six mois pour sa plus petite. Pour elle, 'ce n'est plus une vie' Un 'bon peinture' pour 'cacher la misère' Il y a quelques jours, Vanessa a reçu un 'bon peinture' de la part de son bailleur, Plurial Novila. 'C’est pour cacher la misère, mais ça ne règlera pas le problème', c onteste-t-elle. Pour elle et ses enfants, c’est une urgence : il faut faire des travaux dans la maison.

423340201,"Les images des pilotes de F1 au bout de leurs forces à l'issue d'un Grand Prix du Qatar très chaud ont fait le tour des réseaux et suscité autant d'inquiétudes que de grognements. En vrac, Fernando Alonso a demandé à être rafraichi en pleine course, Logan Sargeant, déjà affaibli par une grippe, a renoncé volontairement, Esteban Ocon a eu la nausée au bout de 15 tours, George Russell, perclus de crampes, a cherché la moindre brise tandis que Alex Albon et Lance Stroll ont été emmenés au service médical pour y rester en observation pendant de longues minutes. Personne n'a été épargné, à l'instar des trois premiers s'écroulant de fatigue dans la cool room après l'arrivée. 'Nous voyions flou dans les virages à haute vitesse à partir de la mi-course. La pression sanguine chutait et on était au bord de l'évanouissement' , résume Stroll. À Losail, au moment de la course, il faisait 33 degrés celsius. Ce n'est pas un record de chaleur, Bahreïn 2005 étant toujours le Grand Prix le plus chaud de l'histoire de la F1 avec 42,5 degrés dans l'air ! Mais le taux d'humidité était très élevé dans la nuit qatarie, avec un taux relevé de 77%. Le tout avec quasiment pas de vent. La journée, s'il faisait moins humide, les 40 degrés étaient allègrement atteints. Il faisait donc irrespirable au milieu du désert et tous ceux qui ont dû braver les éléments ont souffert. Les journalistes, dont votre serviteur, étaient en nage rien qu'à arpenter les méandres du circuit. Alors, imaginez le calvaire qu'ont subi dix-neuf pilotes (Carlos Sainz était forfait, Ferrari H.S) dans les habitacles chauffés à blanc sur une piste de Losail sollicitant déjà beaucoup les organismes ! L'an prochain, le Grand Prix du Qatar se déroulera le 1er décembre et fera office d'avant-dernière manche de la saison. Un écart de deux mois qui devrait changer beaucoup de choses. En effet, l'émirat achève seulement son été et l'édition 2024 aura lieu au coeur de l'automne. Le thermomètre devrait descendre d'une petite dizaine de degrés, ce qui devrait rendre le Grand Prix plus respirable et moins difficile pour les pilotes. 'Comme un kebab au barbecue' Par ailleurs, la FIA a annoncé qu'elle avait entamé une analyse afin de prendre des mesures pour les prochaines courses disputées dans des conditions climatiques éprouvantes, à l'instar des autres Grands Prix se déroulant au Moyen-Orient ou encore Singapour. 'On ne devrait pas attendre des pilotes qu’ils courent dans des conditions qui pourraient mettre en péril leur santé ou leur sécurité', indique la Fédération dans un communiqué. ' Des mesures pourraient inclure une préparation spécifique pour les compétiteurs, une amélioration de l’aération dans les cockpits ainsi qu’une adaptation du calendrier afin de rencontrer des conditions climatiques plus acceptables' 'Des recherches de la part d’autres séries, comme les compétitions de rallye-raid, seront examinées pour en retirer les enseignements lors des courses en circuit, ajoute le document. Ces mesures seront discutées lors d’une prochaine réunion de la Commission médicale de la FIA à Paris'. Une déclaration de Fred Vasseur, le patron de Ferrari, résume très bien ce qui a été vécu au Qatar : 'Moi-même, sur le muret des stands j’étais comme un kebab au barbecue, donc je veux bien les croire ! C’était dur, très dur ! Je ne sais pas comment les pilotes ont tenu dans la voiture. Physiquement pour eux, ils ont tous réalisé une performance exceptionnelle'.

E’ con la voce rotta dall’emozione che papà Alessandro Conte , residente a Lesmo , poco lontano dal nostro territorio, parla del suo Liam , il figlio scomparso improvvisamente a soli 18 mesi. A strapparlo drammaticamente, come raccontano i colleghi di primamonza.it , a quella vita che ancora lo attendeva a braccia aperte è stato un infarto dell’intestino. Ciao piccolo Liam, vita spezzata a soli 18 mesi. Un malore improvviso che lo ha colpito nel pomeriggio di mercoledì scorso. E che, nel giro di poche ore, se l’è portato via per sempre. E’ successo tutto così in fretta - racconta il padre stretto accanto alla moglie, Cetty , e agli altri quatto figli ancora sconvolti dal dolore - Al mattino ha giocato senza nessun problema. Nel primo pomeriggio, subito dopo aver mangiato, ha iniziato ad accusare piccoli sintomi di nausea. Non ci è sembrato nulla di particolarmente preoccupante, ma abbiamo comunque chiamato subito la pediatra. Anche per la dottoressa sembrava si trattasse di una gastroenterite. Ci siamo tranquillizzati anche noi, anche perché con altri quattro figli davanti ne abbiamo viste tante e pensavamo a qualche piccolo malanno stagionale'. La corsa in ospedale. Nessuno però poteva immaginare che la situazione potesse precipitare nel giro di così poco tempo. 'Nel corso del pomeriggio Liam è peggiorato, così abbiamo deciso di portarlo subito in Pronto soccorso per sicurezza e in via preventiva, pensando stesse soffrendo di un’influenza - prosegue il papà, addolorato - Come sono tornato a casa dal lavoro, però, è andato in arresto cardiaco. Ho iniziato a praticargli il massaggio cardiaco in attesa dell’ambulanza, nel frattempo allertata. Al loro arrivo sono stati i soccorritori a proseguire le manovre'.

423378014,"A 'baguette de tradition', or traditional baguette, is made from flour, water, salt and yeast. Period. Sounds simple, and on one level it is. Yet so much depends on the perfect baguette and the perfect baguette is elusive. A crunchy deep golden crust must encase a fluffy, slightly salty interior, punctuated with the small air sacs, known as alveoli, that produce a mildly chewy consistency. Appearance, taste, texture and smell must find a delicate harmony. French President Emmanuel Macron in Germany on Tuesday. This requires hard work. Selvarajah was a little irritated because his store assistants had not appeared. Always, he said, there’s some excuse. He works six days a week, up to 10 hours a day, and thinks such industry – typical of immigrants trying to get a toehold in a new land – may explain why several winners of the baguette prize over the past decade have been of Tunisian or Senegalese descent. The competition itself is anonymous. 'Baguettes are numbered after being deposited by candidates, then touched, smelled and tasted by a jury of experts,' Olivia Polski, the senior City Hall official who oversees the contest, said. The best baguette, she suggested, should be 'well-baked, light and airy. It should crackle in the mouth'. Baking is 'a tough profession,' said Charlotte Quemy, as she ate a croissant she described as 'top' outside Selvarajah’s bakery. She lives across town but likes to stop off on her way home from her job in the tech sector. 'The French view is: to hell with getting up at 3 in the morning!' Selvarajah arrived in France from Sri Lanka in 2006, and began work in an Italian restaurant making salads and desserts. Through a regular client at the restaurant, Xavier Maulavé, the owner of several bakeries, he was offered a job making bread. 'I knew nothing about baguettes,' Selvarajah said. Slowly, Selvarajah learnt the art, becoming the chief baker in 2012. In 2018, he participated in the baguette competition for the first time, coming in third. Business picked up. By 2021, with Maulavé pursuing other interests, he bought one of his stores. 'And now,' he beamed, 'the president of France is eating a Sri Lankan baker’s baguette every morning!' He loves his batons of bread. They are about 63 centimetres long. They weigh about 280 grams. The baguette’s optimum shelf life is no more than a few hours, often necessitating return visits to the boulangerie in a single day. So it is that, around this instantly recognisable stick of bread, French life still revolves. Of course there are other fine breads, and the rhythms of life have accelerated, as elsewhere. But some things do not change. Any unctuous sauce, say for a blanquette de veau or boeuf bourguignon, must be mopped off the plate with a chunk of baguette. Not to do so would be sacrilege. No oozing Camembert or delectable cured ham can go unaccompanied by a baguette. No breakfast at a cafe counter is complete without a 'tartine beurrée' – the divine butter of France thickly spread on strips of baguette. The fruit and tannin of a good Burgundy linger in the mouth as a baguette is chewed, finding in its texture at once crunchy and pillowy, and its mild saltiness, the perfect cradle. Selvarajah came to Paris, where a cousin and brother already lived because he could not find work in Sri Lanka. He has taken a small apartment five minutes from the bakery so that he can keep the gruelling hours of early-morning and late-afternoon shifts, while his wife and young children live in a larger apartment across town. 'I had no choice,' he said. 'I see them when I can.' He makes two or three pilgrimages a year to Chennai in India, where he meets Sri Amma Bhagavan, a contested cult leader whose religious movement, initially called Oneness, inspires him. 'Everyone is so tense today and thinking about money in a selfish way,' he said. 'He helps me to be happy inside my heart.' Still, in his line of work, some tension is unavoidable. Selvarajah smokes. 'Too much stress,' he said. He has a cough. 'It’s from the flour, 100 kilos of it every day.' He is restless. 'You have to prove yourself every day.' The baker’s Sri Lankan wife, whom he married in France, has become a French citizen, and both his children are also French. Will he follow suit? 'Maybe one day,' he said, 'but right now I don’t have time'. His 10-year residence permit is enough. Selvarajah is, however, not altogether happy over what the prize has meant for him. He has not been invited to meet Macron, who had a selfie taken with some previous winners. He feels he has gotten less French media attention than others in the past. Nor was he invited to a party this month organised by the confederation of French bakers marking the anniversary of the creation of the 'traditional baguette', defined with great detail in the 1993 Décret Pain, or Bread Decree, a quintessentially French edict laying out the procedure and characteristics required to be deemed 'traditional'. The baker attributes these perceived slights to the fact he is the first winner who is not from France or a country with a colonial connection to it. He also believes his decision not to become a French citizen is resented. 'It’s not pleasant, but I don’t give a damn,' he said. He thought for a moment. 'I’m thinking about expanding the franchise in Dubai and Sri Lanka, promoting French baguettes made by a Sri Lankan. There are big possibilities.' Asked if the Élysée had paid him for all the baguettes delivered, he said with a shrug: 'Not yet. Maybe at the end of the month.'

423378151,"A 'baguette de tradition', or traditional baguette, is made from flour, water, salt and yeast. Period. Sounds simple, and on one level it is. Yet so much depends on the perfect baguette and the perfect baguette is elusive. A crunchy deep golden crust must encase a fluffy, slightly salty interior, punctuated with the small air sacs, known as alveoli, that produce a mildly chewy consistency. Appearance, taste, texture and smell must find a delicate harmony. French President Emmanuel Macron in Germany on Tuesday. This requires hard work. Selvarajah was a little irritated because his store assistants had not appeared. Always, he said, there’s some excuse. He works six days a week, up to 10 hours a day, and thinks such industry – typical of immigrants trying to get a toehold in a new land – may explain why several winners of the baguette prize over the past decade have been of Tunisian or Senegalese descent. The competition itself is anonymous. 'Baguettes are numbered after being deposited by candidates, then touched, smelled and tasted by a jury of experts,' Olivia Polski, the senior City Hall official who oversees the contest, said. The best baguette, she suggested, should be 'well-baked, light and airy. It should crackle in the mouth'. Baking is 'a tough profession,' said Charlotte Quemy, as she ate a croissant she described as 'top' outside Selvarajah’s bakery. She lives across town but likes to stop off on her way home from her job in the tech sector. 'The French view is: to hell with getting up at 3 in the morning!' Selvarajah arrived in France from Sri Lanka in 2006, and began work in an Italian restaurant making salads and desserts. Through a regular client at the restaurant, Xavier Maulavé, the owner of several bakeries, he was offered a job making bread. 'I knew nothing about baguettes,' Selvarajah said. Slowly, Selvarajah learnt the art, becoming the chief baker in 2012. In 2018, he participated in the baguette competition for the first time, coming in third. Business picked up. By 2021, with Maulavé pursuing other interests, he bought one of his stores. 'And now,' he beamed, 'the president of France is eating a Sri Lankan baker’s baguette every morning!' He loves his batons of bread. They are about 63 centimetres long. They weigh about 280 grams. The baguette’s optimum shelf life is no more than a few hours, often necessitating return visits to the boulangerie in a single day.

423381390,"Terroristerna halshögg också spädbarn med sina bara händer. De slaktade hela familjer, våldtog kvinnor och tog barn och åldringar som gisslan. Islamisterna skändade lik och livesände övergreppen – på offrens egna sociala medier, för deras när och kära att titta på. Grymheterna borde göra varje empatisk människa illamående. CNN:s mångåriga korrespondent Nic Robertson kunde knappt hålla tillbaka tårarna när han rapporterade från brottsplatserna i Israel. I skrivande stund har drygt 1 200 personer berövats livet på ett bestialiskt vis, men man finner hela tider fler lik. Samtidigt skanderar ett tusental Palestina-anhängare i Sydney . Vid Harvard hävdade 34 studentorganisationer i lördags att Israel bär hela skulden för den våldsamma terrorn. I Kristianstad, Malmö och Helsingborg slöt svensk-palestinier upp bakom det palestinska 'upproret'. Vi ser alltså ett öppet, ogenerat stöd i hela västvärlden för fasansfulla grymheter, utförda av en terrororganisation som styr över drygt två miljoner människor i diktaturen Gaza. Det är kväljande. Man kan ha olika uppfattningar om vad kriget beror på, och hur det ska lösas. Men det borde inte vara svårt att ta kraftigt avstånd från den terrorism och antisemitism vi har sett de senaste dagarna. Tack och lov gjorde också samtliga partiledare detta i söndagens tv-debatt. Men. Under veckan har såväl Magdalena Andersson som Nooshi Dadgostar kritiserats hårt av sina egna. Lokalpolitiker för S avsäger sig alla uppdrag i protest mot Anderssons ord om att terrorn är oacceptabel. Kommentarsfälten till hennes inlägg på Instagram är nedlusat av hån och hat från vänsterhåll. Malmös kommunstyrelseordförande Katrin Stjernfeldt-Jammeh (S) presterar bara en ynkligt svagt kommentar på Facebook efter att hundratals bilar med Palestinaflaggor tutat glatt efter lördagens våldsyttring. Den socialdemokratiska riksdagsledamoten Jamal El-Hajs oförmåga och ovilja att ta avstånd från Hamas grymheter i en Expressen-artikel (10/10) är häpnadsväckande, men S-ledningen verkar inte orka ta honom i örat på grund av krav på radikalisering från hans stora väljarskara i Malmö. IVänsterpartiet har folkvalda företrädare öppet krävt Dadgostars avgång för hennes 'svek' att ta avstånd från Hamas attack. Partiets mörka antidemokratiska historia borde också vara väl känd. Detta bidrar till ett allvarligt hot mot svenska judar. De uppmanas nu att inte skylta med sin identitet, synagogor tvingas öka säkerheten och judiska förskolor ställer in utomhusaktiviteter.

423382938,"O governador Rafael Fonteles visitou, nesta quarta-feira (11), a primeira unidade pública especializada no tratamento de pacientes vítimas de acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) tipo III do estado, sediada no Hospital Getúlio Vargas (HGV), em Teresina. Na oportunidade, o gestor anunciou, ainda, uma nova unidade para casos de infarto agudo do miocárdio (IAM). A unidade de AVC, instalada no mês de junho, no maior hospital público do Piauí, conta com 10 leitos e uma equipe especializada composta por neurologistas, clínicos gerais, médicos endovasculares, enfermeiras, fisioterapeutas e fonoaudiólogos. O grande objetivo da unidade é prestar um atendimento mais eficaz e rápido aos acometidos pelo AVC, doença com maior índice de mortalidade no Brasil e no Piauí. Desde junho, cerca de 80 pacientes já passaram pela unidade, sendo 18 deles somente nos primeiros 11 dias de outubro, mês em que os atendimentos foram acelerados. Durante a visita, o governador anunciou a instalação de uma nova unidade no HGV, ainda neste ano, específica para casos de infarto. 'Teremos, em breve, uma nova unidade, semelhante a essa que estamos visitando, mas específica para casos de infarto agudo do miocárdio. Então, estamos felizes em ver o HGV e o nosso sistema como um todo de hospitais estaduais progredindo de maneira eficiente, focado, especialmente, nas principais causas de morte ou de sequelas da nossa população', frisou Rafael Fonteles. Rafael Fonteles destacou a importância da unidade no salvamento de pacientes acometidos pelo AVC, especialmente aqueles de casos mais complexos e de alta gravidade. 'Temos, agora, uma unidade integrada com os hospitais do interior por meio da telemedicina, com o Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência (Samu) estadual e municipal e com as unidades de pronto atendimento. Com isso, temos prestado um atendimento melhor e mais rápido, conseguindo evitar sequelas e salvando muitas vidas', disse o gestor. O governador ressaltou, ainda, que as Linhas de Cuidados do AVC e do Infarto Agudo do Miocárdio (IAM) já foram implementadas em 16 unidades de saúde do Piauí, como forma de interiorizar essas ações. 'Essas unidade hospitalares contam com grande capacidade técnica e de insumos para prestar o melhor atendimento possível. Temos, ainda, o auxílio da telemedicina com especialistas disponíveis nos sete dias da semana e 24 horas por dia', pontuou o gestor. O secretário de Estado da Saúde, Antonio Luiz, explicou que, a partir das Linhas de Cuidados implementadas nos hospitais regionais, mais de 1.200 pacientes já haviam sido atendidos no Piauí. No entanto, o gestor apontou que faltava uma unidade mais completa e para atendimentos mais complexos. 'Sabendo dessa necessidade que tínhamos, implantamos essa unidade dentro do HGV. Agora, contamos com atendimento de altíssima qualidade, 24h ao dia e de forma sequencial, como forma de evitar agravamentos ou novos episódios, além, claro, de salvar vidas', explicou o gestor. A diretora-geral do HGV, Nirvania Carvalho, exaltou os resultados obtidos nos primeiros meses de funcionamento da unidade. 'Recentemente, percebemos um grande aumento no número de atendimentos, a qual relacionamos às várias campanhas que nós do hospital e da Secretaria de Estado da Saúde (Sesapi) fizemos. A partir delas, a população conheceu o serviço e entendeu a real necessidade de buscar atendimento imediato em caso de fortes sintomas. Então, nesses quatro meses de atuação, temos salvado cada vez mais vidas', disse a diretora. Uma das pessoas beneficiadas com a nova unidade foi Gilberto Castro, aposentado de 67 anos, que recebeu os cuidados necessários no HGV logo após ser transferido vindo do Hospital de Urgência de Teresina (HUT). 'Eu acordei e não estava sentindo as pernas e com dificuldades para falar. Minha esposa chamou imediatamente o Samu, que me levou ao HUT e logo me transferiram para cá. Agora, estou bem. Agradeço à equipe do HGV que me atendeu rapidamente', finalizou o paciente. Atenção aos sintomas. Segundo o Ministério da Saúde, existem alguns sinais que o corpo dá que ajudam a reconhecer um Acidente Vascular Cerebral. Os principais sinais de alerta para qualquer tipo de AVC são: fraqueza ou formigamento na face, no braço ou na perna, especialmente em um lado do corpo; confusão mental; alteração da fala ou compreensão, na visão, no equilíbrio, coordenação, tontura ou alteração no andar; dor de cabeça súbita, intensa, sem causa aparente. Ainda segundo o ministério, alguns sintomas indicam o infarto agudo do miocárdio, como dor ou desconforto na região peitoral, podendo irradiar para as costas, rosto, braço esquerdo e, raramente, braço direito. Essa dor costuma ser intensa e prolongada, acompanhada de sensação de peso ou aperto sobre o tórax, provocando suor frio, palidez, falta de ar e sensação de desmaio. Em ambos os casos, o Ministério da Saúde afirma que é fundamental ligar para o Samu (192), Bombeiros (193) ou levar a pessoa imediatamente a um hospital para avaliação clínica detalhada.

Pero eso no es todo también retrataron in fraganti a Olivia Wilde y Billie Eilish y al gran encuentro de dos exSpice Girls, Geri Halliwell y Emma Bunton, en un evento muy glamoroso realizado en Londres. In fraganti. Diane Kruger está muy orgullosa de su hija. La actriz se emocionó hasta las lágrimas cuando iba caminando por las calles del Soho de Manhattan y la pequeña tuvo un gran gesto que la tomó por sorpresa. ¿Qué hizo? Al ver a una persona en situación de calle se acercó a ella y le dio algo de dinero. Ante esto, Kruger felicitó a la niña por su acción con un gran abrazo. Si hay alguien que no es muy amante de las guardias periodísticas y la persecución de los paparazzi esa es Blake Lively. Hace unas semanas, la actriz y su marido, Ryan Reynolds, protagonizaron una acalorada discusión con un fotógrafo que les tomó unas imágenes mientras estaban de compras por Manhattan. Esta vez la intérprete de Gossip Girl se mostró más amigable al descubrir que sus pasos estaban siendo captados por los fotógrafos mientras ella realizaba algunos trámites por Nueva York. Otra de las que fue capturada in fraganti mientras disfrutaba de un rico almuerzo con amigos fue Ana de Armas . La actriz cubano-española volvió a España después de rodar en los Estados Unidos y se la vio paseando por las callecitas de Madrid y disfrutando de algunas de sus exquisiteces. Totalmente recuperado, Jamie Foxx celebró el cumpleaños de 15 de su hija Anelise . El lugar elegido fue Nobu, en Malibú, en donde acudieron amigos y familiares con una montaña de regalos. Antes del gran festejo, Foxx recurrió a su cuenta de Instagram para desearle públicamente un muy feliz cumpleaños a la adolescente. 'Detrás de ese cabello hay una niña increíble que está creciendo. ¡Feliz cumpleaños Anelise! ¡Mi hermosa hija!', escribió sin poder creer el paso del tiempo. Junto a su saludo, este padre orgulloso publicó un carrusel de la quinceañera con esa melena rizada que la caracteriza. Con una camisa verde estridente y un sombrero súper llamativo, Jamie Foxx organizó una gran fiesta por el cumpleaños de 15 de su hija.

423383530,"(Reuters) – South Korean golfer An Byeong-hun has been suspended by the PGA Tour for three months for a doping violation, the U.S.-based circuit said on Wednesday. An, who is 53rd in the world rankings, tested positive for a substance prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency contained in a cough medicine available over the counter in his native Korea, the PGA Tour said. The 32-year-old An, whose suspension is retroactive to Aug. 31, will be eligible to return to competition on Dec. 1. An recorded four top-10 finishes in 31 events during the 2022-23 PGA Tour season.

423380515,"Terroristerna halshögg också spädbarn med sina bara händer. De slaktade hela familjer, våldtog kvinnor och tog barn och åldringar som gisslan. Islamisterna skändade lik och livesände övergreppen – på offrens egna sociala medier, för deras när och kära att titta på. Grymheterna borde göra varje empatisk människa illamående. CNN:s mångåriga korrespondent Nic Robertson kunde knappt hålla tillbaka tårarna när han rapporterade från brottsplatserna i Israel. I skrivande stund har drygt 1 200 personer berövats livet på ett bestialiskt vis, men man finner hela tider fler lik. Samtidigt skanderar ett tusental Palestina-anhängare i Sydney . Vid Harvard hävdade 34 studentorganisationer i lördags att Israel bär hela skulden för den våldsamma terrorn. I Kristianstad, Malmö och Helsingborg slöt svensk-palestinier upp bakom det palestinska 'upproret'. Vi ser alltså ett öppet, ogenerat stöd i hela västvärlden för fasansfulla grymheter, utförda av en terrororganisation som styr över drygt två miljoner människor i diktaturen Gaza. Det är kväljande. Man kan ha olika uppfattningar om vad kriget beror på, och hur det ska lösas. Men det borde inte vara svårt att ta kraftigt avstånd från den terrorism och antisemitism vi har sett de senaste dagarna. Tack och lov gjorde också samtliga partiledare detta i söndagens tv-debatt. Men. Under veckan har såväl Magdalena Andersson som Nooshi Dadgostar kritiserats hårt av sina egna. Lokalpolitiker för S avsäger sig alla uppdrag i protest mot Anderssons ord om att terrorn är oacceptabel. Kommentarsfälten till hennes inlägg på Instagram är nedlusat av hån och hat från vänsterhåll. Malmös kommunstyrelseordförande Katrin Stjernfeldt-Jammeh (S) presterar bara en ynkligt svagt kommentar på Facebook efter att hundratals bilar med Palestinaflaggor tutat glatt efter lördagens våldsyttring. Den socialdemokratiska riksdagsledamoten Jamal El-Hajs oförmåga och ovilja att ta avstånd från Hamas grymheter i en Expressen-artikel (10/10) är häpnadsväckande, men S-ledningen verkar inte orka ta honom i örat på grund av krav på radikalisering från hans stora väljarskara i Malmö. IVänsterpartiet har folkvalda företrädare öppet krävt Dadgostars avgång för hennes 'svek' att ta avstånd från Hamas attack. Partiets mörka antidemokratiska historia borde också vara väl känd. Detta bidrar till ett allvarligt hot mot svenska judar. De uppmanas nu att inte skylta med sin identitet, synagogor tvingas öka säkerheten och judiska förskolor ställer in utomhusaktiviteter. Det säger mycket om hur utbrett judehatet är i vårt land. Särskilt inom vänstern och extremhögern. Det är förstås alldeles uppåt väggarna att en grupp svenskar inte kan känna sig säkra när de ser firande av Hamas blodiga terror mot judar på svenska gator.

423382778,"Bottomless brunches are banned in a large number of states. According to data from the National Institutes of Health, 24 states, including Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania, prohibit restaurants and bars from offering unlimited drinks for a set price or time. Still, both awareness and enforcement can be spotty, and some eateries have found workarounds. Servers and staff at restaurants have long groused about the ill behaviour of brunchers determined to wring the most out of mimosa deals. On Reddit, a thread for venting waitstaff titled 'bottomless mimosas can go to hell' documented stories of bubbly-fueled nightmare patrons who squat at tables for hours. On other anonymous forums, servers admit to watering down the drinks of imbibers, swapping in sparkling water for wine – confirming the suspicions of many critics of the bottomless-brunch phenomenon. 'People get so messy with bottomless drinks, especially early-20s kids and the dreaded mimosa moms,' one server wrote. Of course, servers are often trained to watch out for clearly intoxicated customers – in some cases by state-mandated programs – but in the chaos of a brunch service, particularly if tables are being served with carafes or bottles, would-be sick diners can be difficult to spot. While they are relatively rare in restaurants, vomit fees are common in taxis and car services. But those are not without controversy. Uber’s policy states that riders are charged a cleaning fee that is 'assessed and charged according to the extent of damage.' Lyft has a similar policy and says typical fees for pukers range from $40 to $150. But some riders have complained they were charged for messes they didn’t make in what some reports called 'vomit fraud.' Will the micro-trend of making brunch customers pay up for throwing up catch on more broadly? California is often a vanguard for cultural trends, from farm-to-table dining to legal marijuana. And no doubt that would be welcome to restaurant staff as a deterrent to overindulging guests. Or restaurants wanting to avoid such messy scenarios could simply … keep the bottom on those bottles?",9578,bottomless brunch ban large number state accord datum national institutes health state include texas virginia pennsylvania prohibit restaurant bar offer unlimited drink set price time awareness enforcement spotty eatery find workaround server staff restaurant long grouse ill behaviour bruncher determined wring mimosa deal reddit thread vent waitstaff title bottomless mimosa hell document story bubbly fuel nightmare patron squat table hour anonymous forum server admit water drink imbiber swap sparkle water wine confirm suspicion critic bottomless brunch phenomenon people messy bottomless drink especially kid dreaded mimosa mom server write course server train watch clearly intoxicate customer case state mandate program chaos brunch service particularly table serve carafe bottle sick diner difficult spot relatively rare restaurant vomit fee common taxi car service controversy uber policy state rider charge cleaning fee assessed charge accord extent damage lyft similar policy say typical fee puker range rider complain charge mess report call vomit fraud micro trend make brunch customer pay throw catch broadly california vanguard cultural trend farm table dining legal marijuana doubt welcome restaurant staff deterrent overindulge guest restaurant want avoid messy scenario simply bottle

El caso de violencia ocurrido al interior de las aulas del país asiático ha dado la vuelta al mundo. El deceso del menor se produjo después de que el docente le propinó una bofetada que después derivó en complicaciones en su salud, lo que finalmente culminó con la muerte del menor, según informaron La víctima fue identificada como Francis Jay Dumikib , quien días antes de su deceso, acusó a su maestro de haber sido quien lo golpeó en medio de una clase, por un caso de indisciplina.

Alumno tuvo fuertes dolores en el oído y en la cabeza tras recibir la bofetada del profesor. Imagen referencial La bofetada acabó con la vida del menor. Tras la valoración médica, los especialistas pudieron determinar que el dolor que sentía el menor en la cabeza y en el oído era porque la bofetada le causó una hemorragia cerebral que al cabo de poco más de una semana se determinó como la causa de la muerte. Luego del diagnóstico, el menor tuvo que ser internado en un hospital donde, según medios locales, Francis empezó a sentir síntomas como vómitos y mareos propios del daño cerebral ocasionada por la cachetada.

423390948,"Paciente sente dores que estão ligadas a problemas com a saúde mental; diagnóstico nem sempre é fácil e envolve equipe multidisciplinar. Não é difícil encontrar pessoas que se queixam há anos de dores que não são detectáveis em exames de imagem e enfrentam dificuldades para obter um diagnóstico. Saber diferenciar os sintomas físicos de origem psíquica é um dos grandes desafios tanto para os médicos quanto para os pacientes. A resposta para esse intrincado mistério é a somatização, que é uma condição psicossomática que se manifesta como uma desordem física no corpo, originada ou agravada pelas emoções do paciente. A somatização pode surgir após um trauma, separação, luto, episódio de estresse, entre outras causas. Geralmente, explicam os especialistas, aqueles que somatizam percebem apenas os sintomas físicos e não os relacionam a algum transtorno mental. 'Costumo explicar que a somatização é um termo guarda-chuva que se refere a um conjunto de sintomas físicos relacionados a algum conflito intrapsíquico, mental ou estresse vivenciado por uma pessoa que tem dificuldade de falar sobre ou lidar com seus sentimentos e emoções', explica o psiquiatra Luiz Gustavo Vala Zoldan, coordenador médico de saúde mental do Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. Ele diz que esse conflito interno acaba se expressando em sintomas físicos, que podem incluir dores pelo corpo, como articulares, musculares, de cabeça e abdominais, podendo até parecer uma gastrite, mas não se limitando a isso. 'A somatização pode ainda causar taquicardias, dormências, formigamentos em partes do corpo, distúrbios na fala, alterações na marcha ou até mesmo um tipo de paralisação de algum membro inferior ou superior', diz Zoldan. Conforme a Classificação Estatística Internacional de Doenças e Problemas Relacionados com a Saúde (CID), para ser considerado um somatizador, o paciente deve apresentar mais de três sintomas, de sistemas orgânicos diferentes, por mais de dois anos. São eles: Dolorosos: dor de cabeça, nas costas ou articular; Gastrointestinais: náusea, diarreia ou vômito; Cardiorrespiratórios: falta de ar, palpitação, taquicardia ou aperto no peito; Neurológicos: lapsos de memória, visão embaçada/turva ou dificuldade de raciocínio, dormências, paralisias, distúrbios na fala ou alterações na marcha; Sexuais/reprodutivos: baixa libido, dores na relação sexual ou alterações no ciclo menstrual. Somatização: sintomas são reais ou inventados? O psiquiatra explica que é muito importante esclarecer que esses sintomas, dores e sensações são reais, não imaginários. 'É diferente do que chamamos de simulação ou outros processos. Na simulação, de fato, o paciente produz algum tipo de sintoma intencionalmente para algum ganho secundário. Já na somatização, não há nenhum ganho secundário. É basicamente uma resposta do corpo, como um mecanismo de proteção por não conseguir lidar com uma situação dolorosa ou estressante. É tudo real: dores, paralisias, formigamentos, espasmos em partes da musculatura, falta de sensibilidade em áreas do corpo, tudo isso sendo evidenciado por exame físico e que pode ser mensurado', afirma. Apenas aqueles que passaram ou estão passando por um processo de somatização compreendem o peso dessa carga, que frequentemente perdura por anos. Esse foi o caso de Maria Martha da Fé, uma autônoma carioca de 58 anos, que começou a sentir os sintomas aos 38 e só conseguiu receber o diagnóstico correto aos 45. A partir do momento em que começou a sentir episódios de mal-estar, irritabilidade, dores pelo corpo – inclusive nas articulações -, insônia e ansiedade, ela procurou ajuda médica, passando por diversas especialidades, como clínico geral, ortopedista, reumatologista e dermatologista. A autônoma também fez muitos exames, como ultrassonografias, ressonância magnética e até uma biópsia para investigar um câncer. 'Recebi diversos diagnósticos como sobrecarga emocional, síndrome de Burnout, fibromialgia, condropatia patelar (quando as lesões da cartilagem ocorrem na patela do joelho), abaulamento da coluna (hérnias de disco em estágio inicial), até que busquei um psiquiatra por indicações desses profissionais. Foram oito anos para que eu fosse diagnosticada corretamente', conta a paciente, que participou de um grupo de apoio. 'Éramos um grupo de mulheres com a terapeuta. Colocamos ali todos os nossos sentimentos e preocupações para fora, aprendendo como lidar com nossas dores internas', complementa. Ela conta que também foi orientada pelos médicos a praticar atividades físicas, como musculação, hidroginástica e diversos outros tratamentos para fortalecer musculatura e articulações, além de trazer relaxamento. 'Nos últimos anos, entendi que a somatização dessas dores e inflamações afeta o meu emocional, as relações sociais e conjugais, além do trabalho. Todo esse processo trouxe um prejuízo emocional muito grande. Tive que repensar toda a minha vida. É importante explicar que os sintomas não desaparecem, apenas tratamos do nosso emocional e conseguimos estabilizar os sintomas', conta. Mecanismo de ‘luta e fuga’ No processo de somatização ocorre o mecanismo de 'luta ou fuga' decorrente da preocupação excessiva com os sintomas apresentados, o que leva o organismo a liberar uma série de hormônios. 'Algumas pesquisas já revelaram que o sistema nervoso simpático guarda uma relação íntima com o estresse. Essa divisão do sistema nervoso autônomo controla as respostas do organismo em situações de perigo iminente. Por meio de uma onda de adrenalina e cortisol, o sistema nervoso simpático faz o coração bater mais rápido, a pressão arterial subir, a respiração acelerar e as pupilas dilatarem, entre outros efeitos sistêmicos que preparam o corpo para responder rapidamente em situações de luta ou fuga', explica a coordenadora da pós-graduação em Endocrinologia do Instituto Superior de Medicina (ISMD), Claudia Chang. Como deve ser feito o diagnóstico? Segundo Zoldan, o diagnóstico correto de somatização é obtido por meio de uma história clínica bem-feita, uma anamnese psiquiátrica adequada, além de exames físicos e psíquicos. 'Os exames físicos, em especial, são fundamentais, uma vez que em casos de paralisias, parestesias ou mesmo dores é possível perceber incongruências em relação à região paralisada e que podem sugerir um diagnóstico mais somático. Ainda assim, serão necessários exames complementares para eliminar a possibilidade de causas orgânicas e fechar o diagnóstico de somatização', explica o psiquiatra do Einstein. O tratamento da somatização deve ser sempre com uma equipe multidisciplinar, envolvendo a participação de médicos, psicólogos e psiquiatras. O objetivo é ajudar o paciente a entender a relação entre os seus sintomas físicos e a sua saúde mental, além de desenvolver mecanismos de enfrentamento para lidar com o estresse e as emoções negativas. 'Algumas vezes o processo envolve ainda a indicação de medicamentos psiquiátricos, principalmente quando é diagnosticada uma depressão, ansiedade ou outro transtornos psiquiátricos. Nesses casos, são indicados antidepressivos, ansiolíticos ou até mesmo antipsicóticos em doses mais baixas. Entretanto, o tratamento principal da somatização é a psicoterapia, seja através de Terapia Cognitivo Comportamental (TCC), Terapia Interpessoal (TIP), psicanálise, entre outras linhas', ressalta o especialista. O psiquiatra sempre orienta seus pacientes diagnosticados com somatização a iniciar o processo de psicoterapia, cuidar da higiene do sono, buscar novas formas de incluir mais momentos de bem-estar e atividades prazerosas em seu dia, além de procurar maneiras diferentes de lidar com seus problemas, com apoio social e rede de proteção. Outra recomendação essencial é não ingerir bebidas alcoólicas, drogas ilícitas ou medicamentos por conta própria, uma vez que isso pode agravar os sintomas da somatização. 'Mesmo que gere uma sensação de melhora provisória, isso pode fazer com que os sintomas voltem com muito mais força', alerta Zoldan. Atividade física faz parte do tratamento. A prática regular de atividades físicas também é recomendada, pois o movimento é uma excelente maneira de lidar com o estresse e as dificuldades da vida. Além disso, aumenta a produção de endorfina, que, por sua vez, promove uma sensação de bem-estar e auxilia na gestão do estresse. 'A endorfina é um hormônio que é produzido pela hipófise anterior em resposta a alguns estímulos, dentre eles, a atividade física. Assim como outros hormônios e neurotransmissores, como a serotonina, a ocitocina e a dopamina, possuem ação em determinadas áreas do cérebro envolvidas no mecanismo de prazer e recompensa', explica a endocrinologista Chang. 'A partir do momento em que essas áreas são ativadas, há uma redução no mecanismo de ansiedade e na ativação corticotrófica (via do cortisol), atenuando os sintomas psíquicos e, consequentemente, também os físicos decorrentes do quadro de somatização', finaliza.

Segundo o Tribunal de Justiça de São Paulo (TJ-SP), cabe recurso. O que aconteceu. O advogado de defesa de Thiago Brennand, Roberto Podval, afirmou, por meio de nota que, a condenação foi 'injusta'. 'A defesa recebe com grande irresignação a sentença proferida pelo magistrado da 2ª Vara da Comarca de Porto Feliz', diz a nota. Na avaliação da defesa, a sentença foi 'fundamentada apenas na palavra da vítima'. Para os advogados do empresário, a decisão foi 'completamente dissociada de todos os elementos de prova colhidos durante a instrução, os quais demonstraram de forma cristalina que o acusado nunca praticou violência sexual. Os advogados afirmam que a sentença se baseou 'em uma versão de um personagem criado'. 'Preferiu o magistrado trilhar o caminho mais fácil de julgar com base na pessoa e não nos fatos.' A defesa afirmou ainda que 'tem total confiança no Poder Judiciário para corrigir essa injusta condenação.' A condenação não altera o local em que o empresário cumpre pena, segundo a Secretaria de Administração Penitenciária (SAP) de São Paulo.

'Segundo a mulher estrangeira, após o estupro, ela teve um sangramento que deixou o lençol manchado. Brennand teria avisado que não queria que sujasse a roupa de cama. 'Achei que ia reagir, lutar, mas meu corpo, não consegui mexer, fiquei parada.' [No estupro] Falei 'não, o que você está fazendo? Não quero'. Falei gritando, não sei se a empregada ouviu ou não quis ouvir. Se eu não tirasse a [minha] mão, ele ia me machucar muito mais. Eu falei: eu não quero isso.

Ciudad de México.- En el marco del Día de la Salud Mental, el actor y productor Ryan Reynolds se abrió sobre su propia lucha contra la ansiedad a lo largo de su carrera. En una entrevista con el portal Page Six, recordó cuando asistió, hace varios años, al talk show de David Letterman y cómo, antes de salir al escenario, comenzó a sentirse sumamente inseguro. 'Recuerdo que estaba detrás del escenario antes de que se abriera el telón y pensaba: 'Voy a morir. Literalmente voy a morir aquí', compartió el histrión. El telón se abrirá y seré una sinfonía de vómito, como si algo horrible estuviera por suceder!'. Sorprende que, pese a ser uno de los actores más activos, queridos y aparentemente muy sociables en Hollywood, Reynolds siempre haya tratado de esconder su ansiedad. 'Ciertamente tengo mis propios pequeños rituales y ese tipo de cosas que me ayudan a mantener los pies en la tierra y evitar que mi mente se salga de control. A veces soy muy bueno en eso, otras no', admitió. Una de las herramientas que le sirven a Reynolds, según explicó, es la meditación. A través de ella, ha podido lidiar con su ansiedad cada vez más.

423386753,"Jake Carrigan of Hutchinson, Minnesota, recently was at work when his brother sent him an alarming text. Someone posted a picture of a lost dog on Facebook that closely resembled his dog Dozer and that he was potentially hit by a car. Carrigan drove to the location of where the person had seen the dog, but he didn’t appear to be there. Carrigan had to return to work, so he asked his neighbor, Jay, to open Carrigan's garage door in case Dozer came back. The neighbor went to search for the dog as well and discovered he was in a patch of tall grass by trees. Because Dozer wouldn't let Jay get close to him, Jay sent Carrigan the exact location. 'When I found him, he couldn't walk,' Carrigan explained, in a Pet Poison Helpline release. 1 'He bit at my hand when I went to pick him up, which he would never normally do. I knew there was something wrong, so I immediately took him to our veterinarian.' According to Renee Schmid, DVM, DABVT, DABT, a senior veterinary toxicologist at Pet Poison Helpline, when Dozer arrived at Lifelong Veterinary Clinic, he was incapable of moving his rear limbs, was dull, and hypersensitive. 'Abdominal x-rays revealed that the stomach was full, so the medical team induced emesis and found about a pound and a half of what they determined was chocolate brownies containing marijuana,' she explained. Schmid added that marijuana exposure in pets has become more prevalent as states legalize recreational and medicinal marijuana. Over a 6 year period, the Pet Poison Helpline reported a 448% increase in marijuana poisoning in companion animals. 2 Clinical signs of marijuana poisoning in dogs include stumbling and crossing over feet, dull and lethargic, dilated pupils, urinary incontinence, vomiting, tremors and shaking, and agitation. 3. 'The veterinarian told me that after they emptied his stomach, the entire clinic smelled like a marijuana dispensary,' shared Carrigan. 'The whole situation was weird. I don't know if he snuck into someone's house, or if someone fed him the brownies. Maybe they were cooling outside, and he helped himself. I asked my neighbor who I suspect might indulge in such brownies, and he said they didn't come from his house.' Chocolate poisoning from the brownies was also a concern. Schmid said in the release 1 that the severity of chocolate poisoning is dependent on the type and amount of chocolate ingested and the pet’s size. 'Also, be aware that some chocolate products may contain other toxins such as macadamia nuts, raisins, coffee or expresso beans or xylitol,' she noted. 'Ingestion in toxic amounts can result in vomiting, diarrhea, hyperactivity, elevated heart rate, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors and seizures. Death is possible, but rare if the pet receives prompt and appropriate treatment. Interestingly, dogs make up 95% of our chocolate calls.' References Missing dog found high on pot brownies.

423386030,"Wir haben Leserinnen und Leser aufgefordert, uns zu erzählen, an welche Reise sie sich bis heute erinnern und welche Erlebnisse von unterwegs ihr Leben beeinflusst haben. Die Reaktionen waren zahlreich – hier eine Auswahl der Geschichten: Volle Fahrt voraus mit dem Hippie-Bus. «1967 kaufte ich zusammen mit Freunden einen VW-Bus. Wir, zwei Frauen und zwei Männer, fuhren dann ziemlich unvorbereitet und unbekümmert los, hatten Blüemli auf das Auto gemalt und wenig Gepäck dabei. Unser Ziel: Kathmandu, die Hauptstadt Nepals. Seit Teenagertagen habe ich mir gewünscht, dorthin zu reisen. Das nach der Lektüre eines Romans der Autorin Han Suyin. Ich wollte nachprüfen, ob die Männer in Nepal wirklich, wie im Buch beschrieben, eine «Reinkarnation des Gottes Krishna» sind. Im Iran brach ein erster Streit aus. Doch wir rauften uns zusammen, denn es wäre zu peinlich gewesen, nach zwei Wochen bereits wieder heimzukehren. In Kabul, Afghanistan, in einem Restaurant, wo sich all diese VW-Bus-Hippies trafen, lernten wir einen jungen Mann namens «Little Alexander» kennen. Er kam aus Deutschland und hiess eigentlich Tom. Auf seinen VW-Bus hatte er mit Farbe seinen Übernamen hingeschrieben, da er auf den Spuren von Alexander dem Grossen reiste. Ein paar Tage später, in Pakistan, trafen wir Tom dann erneut. Er war jetzt als Tramper unterwegs, und so nahmen wir ihn mit bis nach Kathmandu. Unterwegs erwachte zwischen mir und ihm die Liebe, und die Nepalimänner interessierten mich nicht mehr. Zu Besuch im Teeladen und am Totenfest. «Vor mehr als zehn Jahren, als Neurentner, unternahm ich erstmals eine grosse Reise: Ich besuchte während dreier Monate Asien, den Norden Thailands. Im kleinen Dorf Mae Salong entdeckte ich einen Teeladen. Die Besitzerin hiess Ui. Ihr Vater war Chinese und kämpfte einst im chinesischen Bürgerkrieg gegen Mao, ihre Mutter war eine Burmesin. Nach meinem ersten Besuch hiess es: «Come tomorrow!» Und so ging es während zweier Wochen weiter: Ich wurde täglich eingeladen. Ui und ihre Familie gaben mir aber noch viel mehr: Sie führten mich zur chinesischen Schule und zeigten mir eine Teeplantage, die früher ein Mohnfeld war. Selber unternahm ich eine Wanderung in den Busch, wo verschiedene Volksstämme leben. Die Menschen trugen Trachten aus schwarzem Stoff, bunt bestickt und mit silbernen Knöpfen. Am chinesischen Totenfest füllt sich das Dorf Mae Salong jeweils mit vielen Menschen. Es werden Bräuche zelebriert, bei denen es um die Verbindung mit den Verstorbenen geht. Da hiess es fast überall: «Come to my house». Doch ich war bereits bei Ui zur Feier eingeladen. Diese Liebenswürdigkeit, die Gastfreundschaft, das Dorfleben, die Vielfalt der mir ganz unbekannten Kultur und Bräuche sowie Zeit zu haben und mich auf Unbekanntes einzulassen, das alles hat mich berührt. Es war ein sehr schönes Gefühl, in der Fremde anzukommen und angenommen zu werden. Ich bin sehr dankbar und denke oft an das Dorf Mae Salong und an den kleinen Teeladen und an Ui.» Ueli Furrer (76), Bern Wir standen nach der Wanderung noch per Mail mit ihnen in Kontakt. Unterwegs unterhielten wir uns mehrmals mit freundlichen Einheimischen, die partout nicht verstehen konnten, warum man als Schweizerin nach Irland wandern geht. Ein Einheimischer in Dingle versuchte, uns die richtige Aussprache des berühmten Pubs «An Droichead Beag», das heisst «The Little Bridge» in Gälisch, beizubringen. Wir scheiterten kläglich. Er schlug sich besser und konnte nach einigem Üben recht passabel den Begriff «Schwiizerdüütsch» aussprechen. All diese und viele weitere Erlebnisse machten die Reise zu einem unvergesslichen Abenteuer.» Livia Bühler (25), Erlenbach Eine bedeutungsvolle Gymerreise. «Es war von der Distanz her eine kurze Reise, an die ich mich bis heute erinnere: Eine Landschulwoche im Maggiatal und im Val Bavona. Ich war 18 Jahre alt. Themen waren Emigration aus der Schweiz, insbesondere aus dem mausarmen Tessin, die Tessiner Sprache, Literatur des Schriftstellers Plinio Martini sowie Geografie und Geschichte. Wir waren 18 Gymeler und Gymelerinnen, ein Italienischlehrer und ein Geografielehrer. Diese Reise hat mich geprägt wie keine andere. Denn ich habe gesehen, warum die Bevölkerung im Tessin einst keine andere Wahl hatte, als wegzuziehen, da Dürre oder Unwetter ihnen die Lebensgrundlage nahm. Mir wurde bewusst gemacht, warum Menschen emigrieren müssen. Zudem waren für mich die wilde Natur und der Dialekt, der im Maggiatal gesprochen wird, exotisch. Beides hat mich fasziniert. Ich reise immer noch gerne ins Tessin, um diesen Esprit zu spüren. Dank Facebook habe ich kürzlich den damaligen Italienischlehrer Martino Malinverni wieder getroffen, wir haben zusammen Kaffee getrunken. Das war unglaublich schön und berührend, auch er erinnert sich noch an diese Landschulwoche. Vor allem berührend war für mich, dass er sich gar nicht bewusst war, was diese Reise bei mir bewirkt und bewegt hat. Ohne diese Reise wäre mein Leben völlig okay – aber weniger reich.» Marc Stucki (60), Allmendingen bei Bern Auf dem Rücken der Pferde durch Saudiarabien. «Im März 1988 brachen wir, meine Frau Claudia, zwei Pferde und ich in Riad, der Hauptstadt Saudiarabiens, auf, um fast elf Monate später, im Januar 1989 in der Schweiz anzukommen. Ich hatte als Kind Karl May-Bücher gelesen, die mich zu dieser Reise inspirierten. Hengst Makkouk und Stute Faizah lebten nach der Reise noch viele Jahre mit uns in der Schweiz, und heute haben wir noch fünf Nachkommen von ihnen. Wir durchquerten mit Makkouk und Faizah die Wüsten Arabiens, die Länder Jordanien, Syrien, Türkei, Bulgarien und ein vor dem Auseinanderbrechen stehendes Jugoslawien, eine Strecke von gesamthaft 7500 Kilometern. Der längste und schönste Teil unserer Reise war jener in Saudiarabien. Hier fühlten wir uns nur willkommen und erfuhren die herzliche Gastfreundschaft der Beduinen. Sie nahmen uns auf und sahen uns als Teil von ihnen, meine Frau nannten sie Schwester. Wir fühlten uns bestens behütet. Oft wussten die Leute bereits im Voraus von unserer Ankunft und empfingen uns freudig. In anderen Ländern erlebten wir neben herzlichen Begegnungen vereinzelt Ablehnung. In der Türkei verweigerte man uns manchmal Wasser. Deutsche Camper hatten das einmal beobachtet und entleerten daraufhin den Frischwassertank ihres Fahrzeugs, damit die Pferde zu trinken hatten. All das Erlebte auf dieser Reise ist für mich unbezahlbar und besonders die Erinnerung daran, auf einem über alle Massen stolzen Hengst zu reiten und dieses unbeschreibliche Gefühl von Freiheit geniessen zu dürfen.» Hans-Jürgen Gottet (65), Mont-Crosin Abenteuerliche Reise ans Schwarze Meer. «Im Sommer 2013 bin ich allein mit Zug, Bus und Schiff während zweier Wochen von Bern nach Istanbul und weiter bis ans Schwarze Meer gereist. Unterwegs auf einer griechischen Fähre habe ich das Buch ‹Alexis Sorbas› gelesen. Ich habe mich sehr wohlgefühlt unter den Griechen, diesen aufbrausenden, herzlichen, chaotischen und humorvollen Menschen. Auf der Insel Chios habe ich den höchsten Berg dort erklommen. Weit und breit war niemand sonst, und man sah nur das Meer. Dann ging es mit einer Fähre, so gross wie eine Nussschale, weiter Richtung Türkei. Dort fanden Demonstrationen gegen die Regierung statt. Mehr als einmal habe ich mich hinter einem Auto versteckt, weil geschossen wurde. Wahrscheinlich wirkte ich etwas hilflos: Oft nahmen mich Leute am Arm und führten mich zum nächsten Bus. So habe ich es irgendwie nach Istanbul geschafft. Was für eine Stadt?! Im alten Kern hat es rabenschwarze Holzhäuser, es sieht aus wie in Zermatt. Mit Reis gefüllte Muscheln, von einem Strassenhändler gekauft, bescherten mir einen biblischen Durchfall. Von Istanbul ging es mit dem Bus nach Agva am Schwarzen Meer. Dort habe ich mit dem Velo die Gegend erkundet. Einmal hat mich eine türkische Familie zur Besichtigung einer Tropfsteinhöhle mitgenommen. Am Schluss meiner Reise brachte mich ein Taxifahrer an den Flughafen von Istanbul, und von dort ging es husch, husch zurück nach Genf. Das war meine schönste Reise, wegen der Menschen, der Natur, der Erlebnisse. Ich denke oft daran zurück.» Andreas Iseli (40), Bern.",9578,wir haben leserinnen und leser aufgefordert un zu erzählen welche reise sie sich bis heute erinnern und welche erlebnisse von unterweg ihr

423392970,"Ginebra, 11 oct (Prensa Latina) La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) publicó hoy su primera hoja de ruta para prevenir y tratar las hemorragias postparto, la causa más frecuente de muerte materna durante el embarazo y el parto. Según el organismo, a pesar de ser prevenibles y tratables, las hemorragias postparto provocan unas 70 mil muertes al año. Para las que sobreviven, pueden causar discapacidades y traumas psicológicos que duran años. Detalla que más del 85 por ciento de las muertes se producen en el África subsahariana y Asia meridional. Entre los factores de riesgo están la anemia, las anomalías placentarias y otras complicaciones del embarazo, como infecciones y preclampsia. La hoja de ruta pretende ayudar a los países a abordar las marcadas diferencias en los resultados de supervivencia, que reflejan grandes desigualdades en el acceso a los servicios sanitarios esenciales. Muchos factores de riesgo pueden controlarse con una atención prenatal de calidad, que incluya el acceso a ecografías, y un seguimiento eficaz en las horas posteriores al parto.

Estaban visitando a la bisabuela, que falleció el pasado 4 de octubre', recordó la progenitora. Cuando iban a salir, el niño dio tres pasos cuando ocurrió la tragedia. Una rama de los imponentes árboles que se encuentran en el cementerio cayó sobre el menor e hizo que este perdiera el equilibrio y se golpeara con una de las lápidas. 'Mi hijo iba en la mitad de ellos cuando le cayó la rama a él. Sintieron un golpe, pero creyeron que se había caído. La abuela, que iba al lado de él, bajó la mirada porque la rama le tocó el pie, y luego fue que la tía empezó a gritar: ¡El niño, el niño! Y fue cuando notaron que se pegó contra la lápida, se desnucó, y la rama le quedó incrustada en su cabecita', agregó entre lágrimas la mamá. En medio de la situación, cuentan los familiares que llamaron a una ambulancia, pero esta no llegó. El personal del cementerio también brilló por su ausencia. 'Las personas que estaban en ese momento en el cementerio, arreglando otras tumbas, fueron las que les ayudaron.

423342658,"Don Smith remembers the moment he awoke in an intensive care unit after 13 days in a medically induced coma. His wife and daughter were at his bedside, and he thought it had been only a day since he arrived at the emergency room with foot pain. Smith said his wife 'slowly started filling me in' on the surgery, the coma, the ventilator. The throbbing in his foot had been a signal of a raging problem. 'When you hear someone say a person died of infection, that's sepsis,' said Smith, 66, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, who went to the ER shortly before Christmas 2017. Ultimately, he spent almost two months in the hospital and a rehab center following multiple surgeries to clear the infected tissue and, later, to remove seven toes. Sepsis, the body's extreme response to an infection, affects 1.7 million adults in the United States annually. It stems from fungal, viral, or bacterial infections, similar to what struck Madonna this year, although the singer never said whether she was diagnosed with sepsis. Treatment delays of even a few hours can undermine a patient's chance of survival. Yet sepsis can be difficult to diagnose because some patients don't present with common symptoms like fever, rapid heart rate, or confusion. A Biden administration rule, finalized in August, ups the ante for hospitals, setting specific treatment metrics that must be met for all patients with suspected sepsis, which could help save some of the 350,000 adults who die of infections annually. Children, too, are affected, with some estimates that 75,000 are treated each year for sepsis and up to 20% of them die. Hospitals that fail to meet the requirements risk losing potentially millions in Medicare reimbursement for the year. Still, because the rule applies broadly, it has triggered pushback for its lack of flexibility. Efforts to reduce sepsis deaths are welcome, but 'where it gets controversial becomes 'Is this the best way to do it?'' said Chanu Rhee, an infectious disease physician and associate professor of population medicine at Harvard Medical School. The approach requires that blood tests be done quickly to look for markers that may indicate sepsis. Also, the measures say antibiotics must be started within three hours of identifying a possible case. The quality measures, called the Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock Early Management Bundle, also call for certain other tests and intravenous fluids to keep blood pressure from dropping dangerously low. In the proposed rule, which was issued in May, Medicare regulators wrote that the treatments have resulted in 'significant reductions in hospital length of stay, re-admission rates and mortality,' since the guidelines were initiated in 2015 under a requirement that hospitals simply report whether they were following them or not. 'These are core things that everyone should do every time they see a septic patient,' said Steven Simpson, a critical-care physician, a professor of medicine at the University of Kansas, and the chairman of the Sepsis Alliance, an advocacy group backed by individual, government, and health industry funding. The final rule builds on that earlier effort. Nationwide, an average of 57% of patients received care that met the guidelines in 2021, with the most compliant averaging 80%, according to the Biden administration.

But, starting in fall 2024, hospitals must move beyond simply reporting on the measures and meet the specific treatment benchmarks, which will be added to Medicare's Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program. 'Before, even if you were reporting 0% compliance, you didn't lose your money. Now you actually have to do it,' said Simpson. Failing to meet those measures and other patient-safety standards could be costly: Smaller hospitals could lose 'hundreds of thousands' of dollars in Medicare reimbursements annually; for large institutions, 'it's in the millions-of-dollars range,' said Akin Demehin, senior director of quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association.

The hospital association opposed the final rule, writing in a June letter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that the recommended treatments had not kept up with evolving science and that their focus on quick antibiotic administration for all suspected cases 'has the high potential to lead to excessive use.' That could fuel antibiotic resistance. Similar concerns have been cited by other professional medical associations, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America. In a 2020 paper, it called for modifying the metrics to target only patients with septic shock, the most serious form of the condition, rather than all suspected sepsis cases. The society also argued that physicians need more flexibility. What's more, there is debate over whether broadly implementing the treatment regimen will save lives. Rhee raised this issue early this year in JAMA. In an opinion piece he co-authored, Rhee cited four studies, including one he led, showing broad-spectrum antibiotic use increased after the sepsis bundle was introduced eight years ago, yet there was little or no change in outcomes for patients. 'Unfortunately, we do not have good evidence that implementation of the sepsis policy has led to an improvement in sepsis mortality rates,' he said. Another study offers a different view. It showed that adhering to the treatments reduced deaths by about 5.7% among patients who received them. Medicare officials cited the study and its results in their proposal for the rule. Rhee is unconvinced that the treatment protocols alone led to the drop. Simpson, at the Sepsis Alliance, said there is enough evidence that the effort to follow the treatment standard resulted in improvements, and he is looking forward to more.

'It is quite clear that this works better than what was present before, which was nothing,' Simpson said. If the current sepsis mortality rate could be cut 'by even 5%, we could save a lot of lives.' All those involved agree that awareness is crucial, not only on the part of medical teams, but among patients, too. Crystal Waguespack, 41, a nurse in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said she knew about sepsis but didn't apply that to her own symptoms when she began experiencing severe pain in 2018, two weeks after an operation. 'I never checked to see if I had a fever,' or noticed her increased heart rate, she said. But she did speak up. Waguespack said the severe pain, which occurred on a weekend when her regular doctor was unavailable, led her to see a physician unfamiliar with her case who told her that the pain was normal and that she was simply anxious. So she went to the emergency department. 'I did not take no for an answer, and I think that saved my life,' she said. At the hospital, doctors found she had spinal fluid leaking and a surgery-site infection. She spent 14 days in the hospital battling sepsis, meningitis, and a heart infection. Key takeaways from her experience: Always ask, 'Could this be sepsis?' said advocates. And don't wait. Smith certainly wishes he had gone directly to a hospital instead of first seeing a foot specialist. 'I went to a foot doctor because my foot hurt,' said Smith. 'But a foot doctor is not an infectious disease doctor. You need to get to a place where different kinds of doctors can see you. That's called a hospital.'",9578,don smith remember moment awake intensive care unit day medically induce coma wife daughter bedside think day arrive emergency room foot pain smith say wife slowly start fill surgery coma ventilator throbbing foot signal rage problem hear person die infection sepsis say smith colorado springs colorado go er shortly christmas ultimately spend month hospital rehab center follow multiple surgery clear infected tissue later remove seven toe sepsis body extreme response infection affect million adult united states annually stem fungal viral bacterial infection similar strike madonna year singer say diagnose sepsis treatment delay hour undermine patient chance survival sepsis difficult diagnose patient present common symptom like fever rapid heart rate confusion biden administration rule finalize august up ante hospital set specific treatment metric meet patient suspect sepsis help save adult die infection annually child affect estimate treat year sepsis die hospital fail meet requirement risk lose potentially million medicare reimbursement year rule apply broadly trigger pushback lack flexibility effort reduce sepsis death welcome get controversial good way say chanu rhee infectious disease physician associate professor population medicine harvard medical school approach require blood test quickly look marker indicate sepsis measure antibiotic start hour identify possible case quality measure call severe sepsis septic shock early management bundle certain test intravenous fluid blood pressure drop dangerously low propose rule issue medicare regulator write treatment result significant reduction hospital length stay admission rate mortality guideline initiate requirement hospital simply report follow core thing time septic patient say steven simpson critical care physician professor medicine university kansas chairman sepsis alliance advocacy group back individual government health industry funding final rule build early effort nationwide average patient receive care meet guideline compliant averaging accord biden administration start fall hospital simply report measure meet specific treatment benchmark add medicare hospital value base purchasing program report compliance lose money actually say simpson fail meet measure patient safety standard costly small hospital lose hundred thousand dollar medicare reimbursement annually large institution million dollar range say akin demehin senior director quality patient safety policy american hospital association hospital association oppose final rule write june letter centers medicare medicaid services recommend treatment keep evolve science focus quick antibiotic administration suspect case high potential lead excessive use fuel antibiotic resistance similar concern cite professional medical association include infectious diseases society america paper call modify metric target patient septic shock form condition suspect sepsis case society argue physician need flexibility debate broadly implement treatment regiman save life rhee raise issue early year jama opinion piece co author rhee cite study include lead show broad spectrum antibiotic use increase sepsis bundle introduce year ago little change outcome patient unfortunately good evidence implementation sepsis policy lead improvement sepsis mortality rate say study offer different view show adhere treatment reduce death patient receive medicare official cite study result proposal rule rhee unconvinced treatment protocol lead drop simpson sepsis alliance say evidence effort follow treatment standard result improvement look forward clear work well present simpson say current sepsis mortality rate cut save lot life involve agree awareness crucial medical team patient crystal waguespack nurse baton rouge louisiana say know sepsis apply symptom begin experience severe pain week operation check fever notice increase heart rate say speak waguespack say severe pain occur weekend regular doctor unavailable lead physician unfamiliar case tell pain normal simply anxious go emergency department answer think save life say hospital doctor find spinal fluid leaking surgery site infection spend day hospital battle sepsis meningitis heart infection key takeaway experience ask sepsis say advocate wait smith certainly wish go directly hospital instead see foot specialist go foot doctor foot hurt say smith foot doctor infectious disease doctor need place different kind doctor call hospital

423344625,"W spotkaniu uczestniczyli przedstawiciele Senackiej Komisji Zdrowia, Ministerstwa Zdrowia, członkowie Polskiego Towarzystwa Wspierania Chorych na Włóknienie Płuc, Polskiego Towarzystwa Chorób Płuc oraz eksperci z obszaru pulmonologii, reumatologii i chorób rzadkich. Najważniejsze jest szybkie rozpoznanie. Specjaliści potwierdzili, że liczba pacjentów ze śródmiąższowymi chorobami płuc z postępującym włóknieniem (PF-ILD) jest niedoszacowana. A są to osoby, które nie tylko mierzą się z uciążliwymi objawami, takimi jak: zadyszka, kaszel, zmęczenie, ale także - bez odpowiedniego leczenia - są narażone na dalszy rozwój choroby i przedwczesną śmierć. Wspomniane dolegliwości wynikają z nieodwracalnego włóknienia śródmiąższu oraz pęcherzyków płucnych. Upośledza to właściwe funkcjonowanie płuc i wymianę gazową. Podkreślono, że choć dotąd nie ma skutecznego leczenia, odwracającego skutki choroby, to odpowiednio szybkie rozpoznanie i wdrożenie właściwej terapii pozwala na zmniejszenie stopnia nasilenia objawów oraz poprawę jakości życia pacjentów. Edukacja społeczeństwa może pomóc we wczesnej diagnostyce. — Spotkanie jest po to, aby pokazać, że potrzeby chorych na włóknienie płuc są ważne. Jako lekarze, chcemy, aby ta grupa została usłyszana. Niestety, wciąż nie rozpoznajemy wszystkich chorych na idiopatyczne włóknienie płuc IPF. Przez 6 lat, kiedy w programie lekowym mamy dostęp do leczenia antyfibrotycznego, skorzystało z niego tylko ok. 2 400 osób. Tymczasem już w 2015 r. dane wskazywały na to, że w Polsce mamy co najmniej 6 500 chorych. Naszym celem powinno być odnalezienie tych pacjentów i zaoferowanie im realnej pomocy w postaci właściwej opieki i terapii — podkreśliła podczas spotkania dr n. med. Katarzyna Lewandowska , specjalista chorób wewnętrznych i chorób płuc z I Kliniki Chorób Płuc Instytutu Gruźlicy i Chorób Płuc w Warszawie, zastępca prezesa Polskiego Towarzystwa Wspierania Chorych na Włóknienie Płuc. Jak odpowiedzieć na tę potrzebę? Eksperci podkreślali, że ogromną rolę odgrywają tutaj zarówno jak najwcześniejsza diagnostyka, jak i edukacja społeczeństwa, nakierowana na budowanie świadomości pierwszych objawów choroby. Potrzebne są wielodyscyplinarne zespoły działające w ośrodkach referencyjnych. Choroby włóknieniowe płuc należą do grupy chorób rzadkich. Ich diagnostyka i leczenie powinny być prowadzone w ośrodkach referencyjnych, tzw. centrach doskonałości. Kluczową rolę odrywa przy tym interdyscyplinarna opieka nad chorym. Eksperci zaznaczyli, że obecnie nie ma systemowego ustrukturyzowania takiej formy opieki, więc lekarze budują ją opierając się na międzyludzkich relacjach, a więc pomagając sobie wzajemnie i konsultując się między sobą. Jest to jednak czasowe rozwiązanie. Podkreślali oni bowiem, że wielodyscyplinarne zespoły powinny być złożone z doświadczonych specjalistów (pulmonologów, radiologów, patomorfologów, torakochirurgów, reumatologów) i funkcjonować w centrach referencyjnych. Nadzieję na poprawę tej sytuacji pokładają w Planie dla Chorób Rzadkich. Podsumowując spotkanie, prelegenci wskazali na najpilniejsze zmiany, które powinny zostać wdrożone, aby sytuacja tej grupy chorych uległa poprawie.

Luckily, you need to eat a lot of those pathogens to get sick, according to Schaffner.

423331123,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is releasing the second edition of its Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) guidance. The document aims to equip governments to respond to the health and well-being challenges, opportunities and needs of adolescents. The guidance provides the latest available data on adolescent health and well-being. It also outlines an updated list of core indicators that data should be collected on. Globally, road injury was the top cause of death for adolescent males in 2019. Among female adolescents, the leading causes of death were diarrhoeal diseases among the younger group (10-14 years) and tuberculosis (TB) in the older group (15-19 years). Over the last 20 years, mortality rates have declined among adolescents globally, with the largest decline in older (1519 years) adolescent girls. For non-fatal diseases, the burden has not improved over the past two decades, with the main causes of ill health in this category being: mental health conditions (depressive and anxiety disorders, childhood behavioural disorders), iron deficiency anaemia, skin diseases and migraine. Adolescent well-being depends on a range of factors, including healthy food, education, life skills and employability, connectedness, feeling valued by society, safe and supportive environments, resilience, and the freedom to make choices. To take an appropriately holistic approach, the guidance outlines how to take crosscutting action to support adolescent health and well-being, with mutually reinforcing interventions across sectors, such as health, education, social protection, and telecommunications. Targeted efforts are also required to engage adolescents, as they trust health systems less than adults do and are especially vulnerable to modern-day trends, like online bullying and gaming. There has been substantial progress since the launch of the guidance’s first edition in 2017. A range of World Health Assembly resolutions address these issues, spanning areas such as the health workforce, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), emergencies, and water and sanitation. New initiatives have been established, such as the in 2018 and the Joint Programme on Mental Health and Psychosocial Wellbeing and Development of Children and Adolescents launched by WHO and UNICEF in 2020. 'Informed by the AA-HA! guidance, many more governments are investing in comprehensive and evidence-based adolescent health and well-being programmes, developed in close consultation with adolescents and youth,' said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent and Ageing. 'The commitment to collaboration and working closely with young people catalysed by the first edition can be seen in WHO’s strengthened partnerships with other UN agencies and the newly created WHO Youth Council.' This new version of the AA-HA! guidance also includes an updated package of evidence-based interventions and advises governments on how to set national priorities, implement programmes, and conduct monitoring, evaluation and research. Evidence shows that the smartest investments are coordinated investments in health and education that reinforce each other. The second edition is distinct for integrating the concept of well-being, expanding from a largely health-centric to a more holistic approach to adolescents. It also incorporates learnings from both the application of the first edition and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that the role of schools goes well beyond education to providing critical nutrition, social protection, mental health and other services. The guidance also makes the case for investment in adolescent health and wellbeing. An investment of US$ 1 in adolescent well-being brings a return of US$ 5-10, sometimes more, and putting resources into preventing NCDs during adolescence would yield US$ 400 billion in economic benefits over 50 years globally. This guidance was developed by WHO in collaboration with global partners, including UN Women, UNAIDS, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP and PMNCH.",9578,world health organization release second edition global accelerated action health adolescents aa ha guidance document aim equip government respond health challenge opportunity need adolescent guidance provide late available datum adolescent health outline update list core indicator datum collect globally road injury cause death adolescent male female adolescent lead cause death diarrhoeal disease young group year tuberculosis tb old group year year mortality rate decline adolescent globally large decline old year adolescent girl non fatal disease burden improve past decade main cause ill health category mental health condition depressive anxiety disorder childhood behavioural disorder iron deficiency anaemia skin disease migraine adolescent depend range factor include healthy food education life skill employability connectedness feeling value society safe supportive environment resilience freedom choice appropriately holistic approach guidance outline crosscut action support adolescent health mutually reinforce intervention sector health education social protection telecommunication targeted effort require engage adolescent trust health system adult especially vulnerable modern day trend like online bullying gaming substantial progress launch guidance edition range world health assembly resolution address issue span area health workforce noncommunicable disease ncd emergency water sanitation new initiative establish joint programme mental health psychosocial wellbeing development children adolescents launch unicef inform aa ha guidance government invest comprehensive evidence base adolescent health programme develop close consultation adolescent youth say dr anshu banerjee director maternal newborn child adolescent ageing commitment collaboration work closely young people catalyse edition see strengthen partnership un agency newly create youth council new version aa ha guidance include update package evidence base intervention advise government set national priority implement programme conduct monitoring evaluation research evidence show smart investment coordinate investment health education reinforce second edition distinct integrate concept expand largely health centric holistic approach adolescent incorporate learning application edition pandemic example pandemic highlight role school go education provide critical nutrition social protection mental health service guidance make case investment adolescent health wellbeing investment adolescent bring return put resource prevent ncd adolescence yield billion economic benefit year globally guidance develop collaboration global partner include un women unaids unesco unfpa unicef wfp pmnch
423333021,"'Não há dados sobre a realização de monitoramento dos peixes, sobre a ampliação a testagem dos níveis de mercúrio nas pessoas que vivem em áreas impactadas pelo garimpo, com a priorização de gestantes e crianças menores de cinco anos', afirmou o MPF. Também não há acompanhamento de pessoas intoxicadas pelo metal pesado, afirmou a Procuradoria. 'Percebe-se que ainda não há políticas públicas de saúde indígena bem definidas para a prevenção e o monitoramento dos indígenas cujos índices de mercúrio no organismo superam os limites recomendados pela OMS [Organização Mundial de Saúde]', cita a análise feita pelo MPF a respeito da primeira recomendação.

Houve reiteração sobre a necessidade de declaração de emergência em saúde pública. A ministra da Saúde, Nísia Trindade , foi oficiada pelo MPF no último dia 2, para que explique se acatou ou não a recomendação. No último sábado (7),

ilegais na terra Mundurucu, a partir da entrada de escavadeiras hidráulicas de 2019 em diante. A intensidade da exploração ilegal de ouro explodiu durante o governo de Jair Bolsonaro (PL), em razão do estímulo a invasores nos territórios tradicionais. Os garimpos desorganizam as comunidades mundurukus, geram conflitos internos, engolem roças das aldeias, enlameiam os rios, despejam mercúrio na água e adoecem os indígenas, com avanço de malária e diarreia. O mais grave, porém, é o aumento de casos de crianças e mulheres com doenças neurológicas, o que pode estar conectado à intoxicação por mercúrio.

Meninos e meninas mundurukus têm retardo mental grave e atraso de desenvolvimento, um quadro que pode estar associado à contaminação das mães por mercúrio e que precisa de investigação, segundo profissionais de saúde que acompanham a situação dos indígenas. Em uma das aldeias onde a reportagem esteve —a Katõ, a principal do rio Kabitutu—, três meninas, de dois a sete anos, têm 'retardo mental grave', 'atraso do desenvolvimento psicomotor' e 'transtornos globais de desenvolvimento', como consta em prontuários. As famílias recorrem a pajés da aldeia e de comunidades vizinhas em busca de respostas para a saúde das crianças. Há dificuldade de assistência médica em razão do isolamento e das distâncias –parte das famílias vai até Santarém (PA), e para isso é preciso percorrer os rios Kabitutu e Tapajós até Jacareacanga (PA), o que pode levar cinco horas, e mais 760 km até Santarém.

O governo Lula vem protelando a retirada de invasores da terra Mundurucu, que circulam livremente por rios e aldeias. Garimpos cercam as comunidades e seguem ativos. Em nota, o MPI (Ministério dos Povos Indígenas) afirmou que uma desintrusão é decidida por um comitê interministerial, não somente pela pasta. 'As desintrusões envolvem ações de segurança pública, fiscalização ambiental, promoção à saúde indígena e emprego de logística militar', disse. Estão em curso três desintrusões —nas terras indígenas Yanomami, Apyterewa e Rio dos Índios — e ações preparatórias para plano de proteção da terra Vale do Javari, conforme o ministério. 'A abertura de novas frentes de ações perpassa por uma apuração mais detalhada do comitê.' A reportagem publicada foi o segundo capítulo da série 'Cerco às Aldeias', que mostra a infestação de garimpos até o quintal das comunidades. O primeiro capítulo mostrou a realidade da terra Kayapó , o território mais devastado pela exploração ilegal de ouro no país. Crateras cercam as aldeias, há conivência por parte de grupos de indígenas e cobrança de taxa para ingresso de escavadeiras. Lideranças de aldeias tentam alternativas à atividade predatória, como o crédito de carbono. No caso da terra Mundurucu, já houve um primeiro mapeamento de 111 indígenas que precisavam de atendimento médico em Santarém, em razão de problemas de saúde que podem estar associados ao mercúrio. Essas pessoas dependiam de um monitoramento de toxicidade, conforme um documento da Sesai (Secretaria de Saúde Indígena) de 2021. Os casos ficaram pelo caminho, e não houve efetivação da criação de um centro de referência para patologias decorrentes do mercúrio, previsto para funcionar em Santarém. O MPF recomendou, além da emergência em saúde pública, que as negociações para instalação do centro fossem retomadas. A Procuradoria pediu ainda um monitoramento atualizado da qualidade da água na terra Mundurucu, informações atualizadas sobre fiscalização do uso do mercúrio e um plano de descontinuidade do uso da substância na mineração artesanal. Em janeiro, o Ministério da Saúde declarou estado de emergência em saúde pública na terra Yanomami, em razão da grande quantidade de mortes de indígenas por malária e por doenças associadas à fome —desnutrição, diarreia e pneumonia. A emergência segue em curso.

423390952,"В России 63% женщин и около 60% мужчин имеют избыточную массу тела, в том числе страдают ожирением 25,3% женщин и 17,3% мужчин. А это значит, что они рискуют прожить меньше, чем могли бы, имея нормальный вес. 13 видов рака. Учёные подсчитали, что даже небольшой избыток веса сокращает жизнь на 3-5 лет, ожирение на 10-15. Дело в том, что ожирение фактор риска номер один для целого ряда жизненно опасных заболеваний. Это в первую очередь сердечно-сосудистые и некоторые формы онкологических заболеваний, сахарный диабет, жировая болезнь печени, хронические респираторные заболевания. Всего больше 230 различных осложнений. Если вспомнить недавнюю пандемию ковида, то именно пациенты с лишним весом и ожирением чаще имели самые тяжёлые осложнения. Неслучайно ожирение у нас в стране собираются внести в перечень социально значимых заболеваний наряду с туберкулёзом, ВИЧ, гепатитом и другими. Всемирный день борьбы с ожирением, который отмечается 11 октября, призван как раз привлечь внимание к проблеме. По данным Всемирной организации здравоохранения, она уже приобрела характер эпидемии. Специалисты отмечают, что избыточная масса тела и ожирение входят в число ведущих причин смертности и инвалидности. Каждый год больше 4 млн человек в мире умирают от последствий избыточного веса или ожирения. Только в Европе 1,2 млн. В России пока официальных данных нет, но наверняка цифры не менее пугающие.  Лишний вес это не эстетическая проблема, как думают многие, а метаболическая, когда возникает нарушение обмена веществ. Поэтому лучше принимать меры сразу. А ожирение именно заболевание, причём сложное. Опаснее всего, когда лишний жир откладывается в области талии, формируя фигуру по типу яблоко, так как это означает негативное влияние на внутренние органы. Больше всего страдают сердце и сосуды. При нарушении обмена веществ, вызванном питанием с избыточной калорийностью, появляется не только лишний вес. В крови повышается уровень холестерина. Он откладывается на стенках сосудов, из-за чего ухудшается кровоснабжение органов и тканей. Когда же сам мотор обложен жировой клетчаткой, ему сложнее выталкивать кровь. У людей с избыточным весом в несколько раз чаще возникает гипертония, ишемическая болезнь сердца. Больные с ожирением не могут дышать полной грудью, у них развивается одышка. Развивается кислородное голодание мозга. Страдает и желудочно-кишечный тракт: запоры, геморрой, несварение пищи, нарушение обмена веществ. Суставы тоже начинают болеть, ведь им приходится удерживать вес, намного больший, чем тот, на который они рассчитаны. Перечислять можно долго. Но лучше до этого не доводить. Прибавка на весах повод для тревоги. Если вы сомневаетесь, стоит ли вам снижать вес, это можно проверить. Есть точная формула, когда ставится диагноз ожирение или избыточный вес. Если индекс массы тела (ИМТ = масса тела, кг/рост&sup2;, м) больше или равен 25 это избыточный вес, больше или равен 30 ожирение. Важный показатель окружность талии. Повышенный риск для здоровья возникает, если у мужчины талия больше 94 см, у женщины больше 80 см. Высокий риск 102 и 88 см соответственно. Однако можно и не делать сложных вычислений, чтобы узнать, грозит ли вам опасность. Достаточно посмотреть на весы. Прибавка 1-2 кг уже должна насторожить и заставить задуматься о том, что пора принимать меры. Как лечиться? Сегодня для лечения пациентов с избыточным весом и ожирением в арсенале врачей есть не только диеты с пониженной калорийностью, рекомендации по физической активности, но и специальные препараты для снижения веса, которые помогают выполнять рекомендации врача при переходе на правильный образ жизни и питание. Тем более что зачастую в реальной жизни врачебные рекомендации выполнять очень сложно, и поэтому они нуждаются в медикаментозной поддержке. Ведь доказано, что только 5% пациентов могут изменить свои привычки питания самостоятельно. Например, в назначения врача могут включаться такие препараты, как Редуксин, Голдлайн, Ксеникал, Орлистат, Энлигрия и другие. Лучше всего, если препарат будет действовать комбинированно снижать аппетит и при этом нормализовать обмен веществ, увеличивать расход энергии. Именно поэтому многие врачи при назначении терапии чаще всего делают выбор в пользу препарата Редуксин. Согласно проведённым исследованиям, он способствует снижению аппетита и нормализует обмен веществ. Это значит, что вы по-прежнему сможете наслаждаться любимыми блюдами, но насыщение будет наступать раньше, длиться дольше, а значит, в организм поступит меньше калорий.

423347379,"Table 7 displays the relationship between enrollees’ perceptions and the quality of the physical structure and equipment of the HCFs. The table shows that out of the 99 respondents who rated the physical structure and equipment as Very Good and Good, a higher proportion of them (also 99) had a Very High perception of the HCFs, compared to the 29 respondents who rated the physical structure and equipment as Bad and Very Bad while having a Very High perception. Moreover, the 99 respondents with a Very High perception of the HCFs is higher than the 23 respondents who rated the physical structure and equipment as Bad and Very Bad while having a Very Low perception. Thus, these group comparisons empirically demonstrate a relationship between enrollees’ perception and the quality of physical structure and equipment in the HCFs. The empirical observation that there is a relationship between enrollees’ perception and the quality of physical structure and equipment in the HCFs is supported by inferential statistics. The calculated chi-square value ( χ 2 (16) = 66.750) is higher than the chi-square table ( P < 0.01), indicating that the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternate hypothesis is accepted. Furthermore, Spearman’s correlation coefficient ( r ) of 0.064 shows a positive correlation between enrollees’ perception and the quality of equipment and physical structure in the HCFs. IDI and observation report. During the interviews, participants were asked about the tangible physical aspects (Structure) of the HCFs. An enrollee noted thus: The windows in the female ward are all broken and there is no greenery in the environment. The atmosphere consistently has a foul odor, ranging from vomit to the smell of corpses being embalmed. The smell is always frightful and psychologically torturing. (IDI 6. Male. 60) Enrollees’ assessment of the quality of physical structure in the HCFs also involves evaluating the use of standard and functional equipment in treatment. An interviewee asserted thus: I have not been sent for laboratory diagnosis during my one year of receiving care at this HCF. When I complained about this issue, the doctor seemed to take offense (IDI 9. Female. 28) Another interviewee noted thus: Since only sick people visit hospitals, proper diagnosis should be carried out so that patients can get better and stop visiting the hospital, however, I belief that every medical facility aims to make profit, therefore the longer a patient’s ailment persists, the more frequent they will visit the hospital for treatment. I have been visiting the hospital for treatment of malaria for six months without being asked to do any blood related test (IDI 3. Female. 34) Regarding healthcare services quality, an interviewee asserted thus: The service is good, but the treatment is different from that of out-of-pocket patients because of the bureaucratic nature of the NHIS scheme. The hospital does not really have a problem; it is when the HMO responds to the hospital, that is when they attend to the patient (IDI 9. Female. 28) As observed, care drew upon two things—the type of HCF, and the number of enrollees’ patronizing the HCF. As observed, some HCF was over-patronized, while the opposite was the case for some others thereby delimiting their access to quality care an interviewee asserted thus: Being an NHIS-HMO enrollee means signing up for delay here (in the hospital) where a patient has to arrive the premise as early as 6:00am to hurriedly get treatments only to finish up at 3:00 p.m. This has really affected my health seeking behavior (IDI 3, Female, 34) Regarding process to care, an interviewee summed thus: The medical profiling of HMO patients is such that feels like criminal profiling. It takes too long with a lot of document signing, photocopying of ID card, different PA (Prior authorization) code request from the hospital to the HMO with a lot of “madam, please sit down, the HMO is yet to respond to our mail” most times I want to make payment at the cashier stand, but if the PA code arrives, I will not be refunded either by the HMO nor the hospital, so, I am always left with no other choice than waiting and wasting almost my entire day at the hospital for something that should normally not take above an hour if I were to be a fee paying patient. Most times out of five prescriptions, the hospital can only provide one, two is not covered by the scheme, the other two is usually out of stock (IDI 1. Female. 60) Another respondent shared his observation thus: I noticed out-of-pocket paying patients were able to access various units of the hospital that conducted tests, scans, dialysis, and other procedures. I believe that the equipment in those units is standard and functional. However, as an enrollee, I did not have access to such services, and I am often told that the services were “not covered” under my plan. (IDI 3. Female. 34) Regarding health services outcome , as observed, interviewers showed little or no positiveness to the expected effect of treatments and interventions accessed. An enrollee noted thus: Many times, I am asked to pay the difference for quality medications, tests, and the like… I have to be asking the doctor to be sincere and tell me my health issue as well as the best treatment not as an enrollee but as a patient in need of quality health attention, but I wonder what is the fate of those enrollees who can’t afford to make an out-of-pocket payment? (IDI 6. Male. 60) The response above suggests that enrollees’ experience towards accessing care at the HCFs is bottlenecked (for example, PA code requirement) thereby leading to delay in service delivery and time wasting. The researcher observed that overburdened facilities may have a grossly inefficient impact on health services delivery resulting in long waiting hours. There is an obvious distinction in services accessed by out-of-pocket paying patients and enrollees, and enrollees are required or obligated to make payments at the HCFs for relative services or medications considered high in quality contrary to the services covered by the scheme. The health plan of an enrollee also affects the quality of service rendered, thereby causing enrollees’ to succumb to the out-of-pocket payment method which is perceived to be a more guaranteed route to quality service, this, therefore, negates the scheme’s plan of providing equitable healthcare at a low price. But then, after a thorough look at the scheme’s logo inscription “National Health Insurance Scheme, Easy Access to Healthcare for All” one may assume the undertone is to provide easy access to healthcare for all not easy access to quality healthcare. This, therefore, raises concern for the quality of services accessed at the HCFs by the poor and low economy enrollees’. Conclusively, putting care in a broader perspective from the IDI and observation, HCFs should aim in the direction of the 9th National Health Conference consideration, which advocacy for healthcare models includes a developmental program aiming at group works, action-based health education, and not limiting care to individual healing. It is also clear from the responses provided that patients’ perceptions of the quality of healthcare services they receive are influenced by a range of factors, including the physical state of the healthcare facility, the quality of equipment and testing kits available, and the type of health insurance plan they have. The fact that out-of-pocket paying patients are able to access better quality equipment and services than those with health insurance plans raises concerns about the accessibility and equity of healthcare services for low-income individuals. Discussion for improvement of NHIS-HMO healthcare service delivery. This finding related to the major objective of the study, which was to assess the healthcare service delivery perception among NHIS-HMO enrollees in Lagos hospitals through the Donabedian’s Structure, Process, and Outcome (SPO) Model. Enrollees’ perception was significantly affected by the tangible HCF physical environment variable. This finding reiterates the importance of Mosadeghrad ( 2013 ) environmental attribute in delivering quality healthcare. This also supports the filter theory of attention that the mind is capable of filtering objects in the environment thereby presenting cues, whether positive or negative for perception formation. The positive report on the state of the HCFs physical environment in this study negates that of Adekunle and Olusa ( 2021 ) which indicated decaying public HCFs status. This result can be an implication of Ramez (",9578,table display relationship enrollee perception quality physical structure equipment hcfs table show respondent rate physical structure equipment good

Bringing Bed Bugs Home “You must understand that no one is safe. You can be caught by a bed bug anywhere and unknowingly bring it home with you.” But there are also sharp-eyed netizens who doubt that the little bugs appearing in the film are really the bed bugs that are ravaging Paris? Richard Hall, a professor at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol in the UK, also said that the bugs in the film were not flat enough and did not look like bedbugs that would appear at night. But even so, he couldn’t completely guarantee that it was “definitely not a bed bug.” Just when the British people thought that the French bug crisis was about to happen in London, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that the London Underground will conduct complete cleaning of the carriages every night, and the London City Council will also report to the Paris City Hall Learn from experience and ask for advice on how to prevent bed bugs.

423306280,سوزش سر دل، ترش‌کردگی یا رفلاکس اسید معده، احساس سوزش تند و تیزی است که در معده تولید می‌شود، از قفسه سینه عبور می‌کند و گاهی به گلو می‌رسد. غذا، دارو، وضعیت سلامت، بارداری، سیگار کشیدن و استرس همگی از علت‌های شایع سوزش سر دل هستند. اگرچه این عارضه ناراحت‌کننده است، اما در بیشتر موارد موقتی است و خودبه‌خود برطرف می‌شود. با این حال سوزش سر دل طولانی‌مدت یا مکرر ممکن است نشان‌دهنده مشکلی بزرگ‌تر باشد. سایت تخصصی «وِری‌وِل هلث» در مقاله‌ای به بررسی برخی دلایل سوزش سر دل پرداخته است. سوزش سر دل زمانی پیش می‌آید که اسید‌های گوارشیِ معده در مری، لوله‌ای که دهان و معده را به هم وصل می‌کند، جریان می‌یابد و پوشش داخلی آن را تحریک می‌کند. این حالت وقتی رخ می‌دهد که نوار عضله‌ای که باید این مسیر رو به بالا را ببندد- اسفنکتر تحتانی مری یا همان دریچه مری یا ال‌ای‌اس (LES) - به اندازه کافی محکم بسته نشده است. همه چیز از آنچه می‌خورید یا می‌نوشید گرفته تا بیماری‌های زمینه‌ای، می‌تواند ال‌ای‌اس را ضعیف کند و به حمله ناگهانی رفلاکس اسید منجر شود. محرک‌های غذایی. بیشتر موارد سوزش سر دل به‌دلیل آنچه می‌خوریم یا می‌نوشیم پیش می‌آید. این ناراحتی نشانه بارز سوء‌هاضمه است؛ یعنی زمانی که معده شما بعد از خوردن غذا یا میان‌وعده با مشکل مواجه می‌شود. این مشکل همچنین باعث آروغ زدن، نفخ معده، احساس سیری، حالت تهوع و گاز بعد از غذا می‌شود. الگو‌های مصرف خاص نظیر نوشیدن بیش از حد نوشیدنی‌های الکلی، کافئین یا نوشابه‌های گازدار و همچنین تند غذا خوردن یا دراز کشیدن فوری بعد از غذا خوردن، خطر سوءهاضمه را افزایش می‌دهد و سبب رفلاکس اسید معده می‌شود. غذا‌ها و نوشیدنی‌هایی که ممکن است باعث سوزش سر دل شوند، عبارتند از: الکل. قهوه یا نوشیدنی‌های کافئین‌دار. نوشیدنی‌های گازدار. شکلات. نعناع و نعناع تند. غذا‌های تند، چرب یا پُرچربی. گوجه فرنگی، پیاز یا مرکبات (غذا‌های اسیدی) رفلاکس اسید معده. برخی افراد گاهی دچار یک نوع مزمن و تشدیدکننده رفلاکس اسید معده می‌شوند که آن را بیماری رفلاکس معده به مری (GERD) می‌نامند. این زمانی است که به‌علت شرایط زمینه‌ای، دو یا چند بار در هفته سوزش سر دل و بازگشت مجدد اسید معده پیش می‌آید. از دیگر علائم رفلاکس معده می‌توان به سرفه، خس‌خس سینه، حالت تهوع، مشکل در بلع و گرفتگی صدا اشاره کرد. عوارض جانبی دارو‌ها. یکی دیگر از دلایل سوزش سر دل مصرف دارو است. طیف وسیعی از دارو‌ها از جمله دارو‌های ضدالتهاب غیراستروئیدی مانند ایبوپروفن و آسپرین، آنتی‌بیوتیک‌های خاص، آنتی‌کولینرژیک‌ها مانند آتروپین و بنزوتروپین، دارو‌های آرام‌بخش مانند والیوم (دیازپام) یا آتیوان (لورازپام) و برخی دارو‌های ضدافسردگی باعث سوزش سر دل می‌شوند. بارداری. اگر باردارید و ناگهان احساس سوزش سر دل می‌کنید، بدانید که این نوع رفلاکس اسید معده از ترشح هورمون‌های پروژسترون و استروژن در دوران بارداری ناشی و باعث شل شدن اسفنکتر تحتانی مری یا دریچه مری می‌شود. علاوه بر این، بر اثر رشد جنین در طول بارداری، اندازه رحم بزرگ می‌شود و به شکم فشار می‌آورد. سیگار کشیدن. سیگار کشیدن نیز بر سلامت دستگاه گوارش اثر می‌گذارد. نیکوتین موجود در سیگار می‌تواند دریچه‌های مری را شل کند و خطر سوزش سر دل را افزایش دهد. پژوهشی نشان داد که ۱۴۱ نفر از کسانی که توانسته بودند سیگار کشیدن را ترک کنند در مقایسه با افرادی که سیگار را ترک نکرده بودند، موارد کمتری از ابتلا به این عارضه را گزارش کردند. افزایش سن. برخی افراد در نتیجه سالخوردگی و کهولت سن ابتلا به این ناراحتی را گزارش کردند. بر اثر افزایش سن، ماهیچه‌های دریچه مری ضعیف می‌شود و بر توانایی آن در جلوگیری از خروج اسید‌های معده از معده اثر منفی می‌گذارد. در نتیجه، خطر حمله‌های رفلاکس اسید معده افزایش می‌یابد و همین امر باعث سوزش سر دل می‌شود. فشار روی شکم. اضافه‌وزن یکی دیگر از عوامل سوزش سر دل است. چاقی، سوزش سر معده را بیشتر می‌کند. در برخی موارد، علت رفلاکس ناگهانی اسید معده را می‌توان در لباس‌های تنگی یافت که فشار زیادی به شکم وارد می‌کنند. اضطراب. در پژوهش‌های متعدد به ارتباط بین سلامت روان و دستگاه گوارش بدن اشاره شده است. اضطراب و افسردگی خطر ابتلا به رفلاکس اسید معده را افزایش می‌دهد. سوزش سر دل یکی از علائم اختلال روان و اضطراب است. زخم معده. زخم معده به زخمی گفته می‌شود که به‌دلیل عفونت، استفاده از دارو‌های ضدالتهاب یا غیر استروئیدی و تومور در پوشش معده ایجاد می‌شود. سوزش سر دل از علائم شایع زخم معده است که همراه با احساس سوزش مبهم در معده، از دست دادن اشتها، آروغ زدن، حالت تهوع و کاهش ناگهانی وزن ظاهر می‌شود. سوزش سر دل در زنان و مردان چگونه است؟ به گزارش ایندیپندنت، زنان و مردان ممکن است تجربیات متفاوتی از این بیماری داشته باشند. علاوه بر این، برخی از افراد در شب دچار حمله‌های رفلاکس اسید معده می‌شوند که روی خواب آن‌ها اثر می‌گذارد. اگرچه میزان ناراحتی سوزش سر دل در زنان و مردان مشابه است، تفاوت‌هایی در نحوه مواجهه آن‌ها با بیماری وجود دارد. مطالعات رفلاکس معده در زنان نشان می‌دهد که زنان بیشتر احتمال دارد علائم سوزش سر دل را گزارش کنند. چند نکته درباره سوزش ناگهانی سر دل. عوارض رفلاکس اسید معده مانند التهاب و سرطان مری، افزایش چشمگیری در اواخر زندگی زنان دارد که به نقش بالقوه استروژن در به تاخیر انداختن شروع این بیماری‌ها اشاره می‌کند. در مردان، میزان بیشتری از عوارض مرتبط با سوزش سر دل مانند التهاب و سرطان مری گزارش شده است. با این حال، تفاوت‌های جنسیتی در گزارش‌ها وجود دارد و مردان کمتر از زنان علائم رفلاکس معده را گزارش داده‌اند. چگونه سوزش سر دل ناگهانی و مداوم را مهار کنید؟ اگرچه سوزش سر دل می‌تواند آزاردهنده باشد و اثر محسوسی بر کیفیت زندگی شما بگذارد، کار‌های زیادی برای مدیریت این وضع می‌توانید بکنید. راهبرد‌های موثری برای کنترل رفلاکس اسید معده ناگهانی و مداوم و پیشگیری از آن وجود دارد؛ از ایجاد تغییر در سبک زندگی و رژیم غذایی گرفته تا دقت در مصرف دارو‌های بدون نسخه از جمله این موارد هستند. برخی از راهبرد‌های مهار رفلاکس معده: - از مصرف خوراک‌های تحریک‌کننده مانند غذا‌های تند و اسیدی و نوشیدنی‌های حاوی کافئین پرهیز کنید. - بعد از خوردن غذا، قبل از دراز کشیدن یا خم شدن یا ورزش، چند ساعت صبر کنید. - حجم وعده‌های غذایی را کاهش دهید. - سیگار کشیدن یا جویدن تنباکو را متوقف کنید. - لباس‌های گشاد انتخاب کنید که به شکم فشار نیاید. - اگر اضافه‌وزن دارید یا چاق هستید، وزنتان را کم کنید. - استرس را کاهش دهید و با مدیتیشن، یوگا یا دیگر روش‌های کششی با اضطراب مقابله کنید.,9578,سوزش سر دل یا رفلاکس اسید معده احساس سوزش تند و تیزی است که در معده تولید از قفسه سینه عبور و گاهی به گلو غذا دارو وضعیت سلامت بارداری سیگار کشیدن و استرس همگی از شایع سوزش سر دل هستند اگرچه این عارضه است اما در بیشتر موارد موقتی است و برطرف با این حال سوزش سر دل یا مکرر ممکن است مشکلی باشد سایت تخصصی هلث در به بررسی برخی دلایل سوزش سر دل پرداخته است سوزش سر دل زمانی پیش که معده در مری که دهان و معده را به هم وصل جریان و پوشش داخلی آن را تحریک این حالت وقتی رخ که نوار که باید این مسیر رو به بالا را اسفنکتر تحتانی مری یا همان دریچه مری یا les به اندازه کافی محکم بسته نشده است همه چیز از آنچه یا گرفته تا را ضعیف کند و به حمله ناگهانی رفلاکس اسید منجر شود غذایی بیشتر موارد سوزش سر دل آنچه یا پیش این ناراحتی نشانه بارز است یعنی زمانی که معده شما بعد از خوردن غذا یا با مشکل مواجه این مشکل همچنین باعث آروغ زدن نفخ معده احساس سیری حالت تهوع و گاز بعد از غذا مصرف خاص نظیر نوشیدن بیش از حد الکلی کافئین یا گازدار و همچنین تند غذا خوردن یا دراز کشیدن فوری بعد از غذا خوردن خطر سوءهاضمه را افزایش و سبب رفلاکس اسید معده و که ممکن است باعث سوزش سر دل شوند عبارتند از الکل قهوه یا گازدار شکلات نعناع و نعناع تند تند چرب یا گوجه فرنگی پیاز یا مرکبات اسیدی رفلاکس اسید معده برخی افراد گاهی دچار یک نوع مزمن و تشدیدکننده رفلاکس اسید معده که آن را بیماری رفلاکس معده به مری gerd این زمانی است که شرایط دو یا چند بار در هفته سوزش سر دل و بازگشت مجدد اسید معده پیش از دیگر علائم رفلاکس معده به سرفه سینه حالت تهوع مشکل در بلع و گرفتگی صدا اشاره کرد عوارض جانبی یکی دیگر از دلایل سوزش سر دل مصرف دارو است طیف وسیعی از از جمله ضدالتهاب غیراستروئیدی مانند ایبوپروفن و آسپرین خاص مانند آتروپین و بنزوتروپین مانند والیوم دیازپام یا آتیوان لورازپام و برخی ضدافسردگی باعث سوزش سر دل بارداری اگر باردارید و ناگهان احساس سوزش سر دل بدانید که این نوع رفلاکس اسید معده از ترشح پروژسترون و استروژن در دوران بارداری ناشی و باعث شل شدن اسفنکتر تحتانی مری یا دریچه مری علاوه بر این بر اثر رشد جنین در طول بارداری اندازه رحم بزرگ و به شکم فشار سیگار کشیدن سیگار کشیدن نیز بر سلامت دستگاه گوارش اثر نیکوتین موجود در سیگار مری را شل کند و خطر سوزش سر دل را افزایش دهد پژوهشی نشان داد که نفر از کسانی که توانسته بودند سیگار کشیدن را ترک کنند در مقایسه با افرادی که سیگار را ترک نکرده بودند موارد کمتری از ابتلا به این عارضه را گزارش کردند افزایش سن برخی افراد در نتیجه سالخوردگی و کهولت سن ابتلا به این ناراحتی را گزارش کردند بر اثر افزایش سن دریچه مری ضعیف و بر توانایی آن در جلوگیری از خروج معده از معده اثر منفی در نتیجه خطر رفلاکس اسید معده افزایش و همین امر باعث سوزش سر دل فشار روی شکم یکی دیگر از عوامل سوزش سر دل است چاقی سوزش سر معده را بیشتر در برخی موارد علت رفلاکس ناگهانی اسید معده را در تنگی یافت که فشار زیادی به شکم وارد اضطراب در متعدد به ارتباط بین سلامت روان و دستگاه گوارش بدن اشاره شده است اضطراب و افسردگی خطر ابتلا به رفلاکس اسید معده را افزایش سوزش سر دل یکی از علائم اختلال روان و اضطراب است زخم معده زخم معده به زخمی گفته که عفونت استفاده از ضدالتهاب یا غیر استروئیدی و تومور در پوشش معده ایجاد سوزش سر دل از علائم شایع زخم معده است که همراه با احساس سوزش مبهم در معده از دست دادن اشتها آروغ زدن حالت تهوع و کاهش ناگهانی وزن ظاهر سوزش سر دل در زنان و مردان چگونه است به گزارش ایندیپندنت زنان و مردان ممکن است تجربیات متفاوتی از این بیماری داشته باشند علاوه بر این برخی از افراد در شب دچار رفلاکس اسید معده که روی خواب اثر اگرچه میزان ناراحتی سوزش سر دل در زنان و مردان مشابه است در نحوه مواجهه با بیماری وجود دارد مطالعات رفلاکس معده در زنان نشان که زنان بیشتر احتمال دارد علائم سوزش سر دل را گزارش کنند چند نکته درباره سوزش ناگهانی سر دل عوارض رفلاکس اسید معده مانند التهاب و سرطان مری افزایش چشمگیری در اواخر زندگی زنان دارد که به نقش بالقوه استروژن در به تاخیر انداختن شروع این اشاره در مردان میزان بیشتری از عوارض مرتبط با سوزش سر دل مانند التهاب و سرطان مری گزارش شده است با این حال جنسیتی در وجود دارد و مردان کمتر از زنان علائم رفلاکس معده را گزارش چگونه سوزش سر دل ناگهانی و مداوم را مهار کنید اگرچه سوزش سر دل آزاردهنده باشد و اثر محسوسی بر کیفیت زندگی شما بگذارد زیادی برای مدیریت این وضع بکنید موثری برای کنترل رفلاکس اسید معده ناگهانی و مداوم و پیشگیری از آن وجود دارد از ایجاد تغییر در سبک زندگی و رژیم غذایی گرفته تا دقت در مصرف بدون نسخه از جمله این موارد هستند برخی از مهار رفلاکس معده از مصرف مانند تند و اسیدی و حاوی کافئین پرهیز کنید بعد از خوردن غذا قبل از دراز کشیدن یا خم شدن یا ورزش چند ساعت صبر کنید حجم غذایی را کاهش دهید سیگار کشیدن یا جویدن تنباکو را متوقف کنید گشاد انتخاب کنید که به شکم فشار نیاید اگر دارید یا چاق هستید وزنتان را کم کنید استرس را کاهش دهید و با مدیتیشن یوگا یا دیگر کششی با اضطراب مقابله کنید
423344624,"Wir haben Leserinnen und Leser aufgefordert, uns zu erzählen, an welche Reise sie sich bis heute erinnern und welche Erlebnisse von unterwegs ihr Leben beeinflusst haben. Die Reaktionen waren zahlreich – hier eine Auswahl der Geschichten: Volle Fahrt voraus mit dem Hippie-Bus. «1967 kaufte ich zusammen mit Freunden einen VW-Bus. Wir, zwei Frauen und zwei Männer, fuhren dann ziemlich unvorbereitet und unbekümmert los, hatten Blüemli auf das Auto gemalt und wenig Gepäck dabei. Unser Ziel: Kathmandu, die Hauptstadt Nepals. Seit Teenagertagen habe ich mir gewünscht, dorthin zu reisen. Das nach der Lektüre eines Romans der Autorin Han Suyin. Ich wollte nachprüfen, ob die Männer in Nepal wirklich, wie im Buch beschrieben, eine «Reinkarnation des Gottes Krishna» sind. Im Iran brach ein erster Streit aus. Doch wir rauften uns zusammen, denn es wäre zu peinlich gewesen, nach zwei Wochen bereits wieder heimzukehren. In Kabul, Afghanistan, in einem Restaurant, wo sich all diese VW-Bus-Hippies trafen, lernten wir einen jungen Mann namens «Little Alexander» kennen. Er kam aus Deutschland und hiess eigentlich Tom. Auf seinen VW-Bus hatte er mit Farbe seinen Übernamen hingeschrieben, da er auf den Spuren von Alexander dem Grossen reiste. Ein paar Tage später, in Pakistan, trafen wir Tom dann erneut. Er war jetzt als Tramper unterwegs, und so nahmen wir ihn mit bis nach Kathmandu. Unterwegs erwachte zwischen mir und ihm die Liebe, und die Nepalimänner interessierten mich nicht mehr. Zu Besuch im Teeladen und am Totenfest. «Vor mehr als zehn Jahren, als Neurentner, unternahm ich erstmals eine grosse Reise: Ich besuchte während dreier Monate Asien, den Norden Thailands. Im kleinen Dorf Mae Salong entdeckte ich einen Teeladen. Die Besitzerin hiess Ui. Ihr Vater war Chinese und kämpfte einst im chinesischen Bürgerkrieg gegen Mao, ihre Mutter war eine Burmesin. Nach meinem ersten Besuch hiess es: «Come tomorrow!» Und so ging es während zweier Wochen weiter: Ich wurde täglich eingeladen. Ui und ihre Familie gaben mir aber noch viel mehr: Sie führten mich zur chinesischen Schule und zeigten mir eine Teeplantage, die früher ein Mohnfeld war. Selber unternahm ich eine Wanderung in den Busch, wo verschiedene Volksstämme leben. Die Menschen trugen Trachten aus schwarzem Stoff, bunt bestickt und mit silbernen Knöpfen. Am chinesischen Totenfest füllt sich das Dorf Mae Salong jeweils mit vielen Menschen. Es werden Bräuche zelebriert, bei denen es um die Verbindung mit den Verstorbenen geht. Da hiess es fast überall: «Come to my house». Doch ich war bereits bei Ui zur Feier eingeladen. Diese Liebenswürdigkeit, die Gastfreundschaft, das Dorfleben, die Vielfalt der mir ganz unbekannten Kultur und Bräuche sowie Zeit zu haben und mich auf Unbekanntes einzulassen, das alles hat mich berührt. Es war ein sehr schönes Gefühl, in der Fremde anzukommen und angenommen zu werden. Ich bin sehr dankbar und denke oft an das Dorf Mae Salong und an den kleinen Teeladen und an Ui.» Ueli Furrer (76), Bern Wir standen nach der Wanderung noch per Mail mit ihnen in Kontakt. Unterwegs unterhielten wir uns mehrmals mit freundlichen Einheimischen, die partout nicht verstehen konnten, warum man als Schweizerin nach Irland wandern geht. Ein Einheimischer in Dingle versuchte, uns die richtige Aussprache des berühmten Pubs «An Droichead Beag», das heisst «The Little Bridge» in Gälisch, beizubringen. Wir scheiterten kläglich. Er schlug sich besser und konnte nach einigem Üben recht passabel den Begriff «Schwiizerdüütsch» aussprechen. All diese und viele weitere Erlebnisse machten die Reise zu einem unvergesslichen Abenteuer.» Livia Bühler (25), Erlenbach Eine bedeutungsvolle Gymerreise. «Es war von der Distanz her eine kurze Reise, an die ich mich bis heute erinnere: Eine Landschulwoche im Maggiatal und im Val Bavona. Ich war 18 Jahre alt. Themen waren Emigration aus der Schweiz, insbesondere aus dem mausarmen Tessin, die Tessiner Sprache, Literatur des Schriftstellers Plinio Martini sowie Geografie und Geschichte. Wir waren 18 Gymeler und Gymelerinnen, ein Italienischlehrer und ein Geografielehrer. Diese Reise hat mich geprägt wie keine andere. Denn ich habe gesehen, warum die Bevölkerung im Tessin einst keine andere Wahl hatte, als wegzuziehen, da Dürre oder Unwetter ihnen die Lebensgrundlage nahm. Mir wurde bewusst gemacht, warum Menschen emigrieren müssen. Zudem waren für mich die wilde Natur und der Dialekt, der im Maggiatal gesprochen wird, exotisch. Beides hat mich fasziniert. Ich reise immer noch gerne ins Tessin, um diesen Esprit zu spüren. Dank Facebook habe ich kürzlich den damaligen Italienischlehrer Martino Malinverni wieder getroffen, wir haben zusammen Kaffee getrunken. Das war unglaublich schön und berührend, auch er erinnert sich noch an diese Landschulwoche. Vor allem berührend war für mich, dass er sich gar nicht bewusst war, was diese Reise bei mir bewirkt und bewegt hat. Ohne diese Reise wäre mein Leben völlig okay – aber weniger reich.» Marc Stucki (60), Allmendingen Auf dem Rücken der Pferde durch Saudiarabien. «Im März 1988 brachen wir, meine Frau Claudia, zwei Pferde und ich in Riad, der Hauptstadt Saudiarabiens, auf, um fast elf Monate später, im Januar 1989 in der Schweiz anzukommen. Ich hatte als Kind Karl May-Bücher gelesen, die mich zu dieser Reise inspirierten. Hengst Makkouk und Stute Faizah lebten nach der Reise noch viele Jahre mit uns in der Schweiz, und heute haben wir noch fünf Nachkommen von ihnen. Wir durchquerten mit Makkouk und Faizah die Wüsten Arabiens, die Länder Jordanien, Syrien, Türkei, Bulgarien und ein vor dem Auseinanderbrechen stehendes Jugoslawien, eine Strecke von gesamthaft 7500 Kilometern. Der längste und schönste Teil unserer Reise war jener in Saudiarabien. Hier fühlten wir uns nur willkommen und erfuhren die herzliche Gastfreundschaft der Beduinen. Sie nahmen uns auf und sahen uns als Teil von ihnen, meine Frau nannten sie Schwester. Wir fühlten uns bestens behütet. Oft wussten die Leute bereits im Voraus von unserer Ankunft und empfingen uns freudig. In anderen Ländern erlebten wir neben herzlichen Begegnungen vereinzelt Ablehnung. In der Türkei verweigerte man uns manchmal Wasser. Deutsche Camper hatten das einmal beobachtet und entleerten daraufhin den Frischwassertank ihres Fahrzeugs, damit die Pferde zu trinken hatten. All das Erlebte auf dieser Reise ist für mich unbezahlbar und besonders die Erinnerung daran, auf einem über alle Massen stolzen Hengst zu reiten und dieses unbeschreibliche Gefühl von Freiheit geniessen zu dürfen.» Hans-Jürgen Gottet (65), Mont-Crosin Abenteuerliche Reise ans Schwarze Meer. «Im Sommer 2013 bin ich allein mit Zug, Bus und Schiff während zweier Wochen von Bern nach Istanbul und weiter bis ans Schwarze Meer gereist. Unterwegs auf einer griechischen Fähre habe ich das Buch ‹Alexis Sorbas› gelesen. Ich habe mich sehr wohlgefühlt unter den Griechen, diesen aufbrausenden, herzlichen, chaotischen und humorvollen Menschen. Auf der Insel Chios habe ich den höchsten Berg dort erklommen. Weit und breit war niemand sonst, und man sah nur das Meer. Dann ging es mit einer Fähre, so gross wie eine Nussschale, weiter Richtung Türkei. Dort fanden Demonstrationen gegen die Regierung statt. Mehr als einmal habe ich mich hinter einem Auto versteckt, weil geschossen wurde. Wahrscheinlich wirkte ich etwas hilflos: Oft nahmen mich Leute am Arm und führten mich zum nächsten Bus. So habe ich es irgendwie nach Istanbul geschafft. Was für eine Stadt?! Im alten Kern hat es rabenschwarze Holzhäuser, es sieht aus wie in Zermatt. Mit Reis gefüllte Muscheln, von einem Strassenhändler gekauft, bescherten mir einen biblischen Durchfall. Von Istanbul ging es mit dem Bus nach Agva am Schwarzen Meer. Dort habe ich mit dem Velo die Gegend erkundet. Einmal hat mich eine türkische Familie zur Besichtigung einer Tropfsteinhöhle mitgenommen. Am Schluss meiner Reise brachte mich ein Taxifahrer an den Flughafen von Istanbul, und von dort ging es husch, husch zurück nach Genf. Das war meine schönste Reise, wegen der Menschen, der Natur, der Erlebnisse. Ich denke oft daran zurück.» Andreas Iseli (40), Bern.",9578,wir haben leserinnen und leser aufgefordert un zu erzählen welche reise sie sich bis heute erinnern und welche erlebnisse von unterweg ihr

آبیاری می‌کردند را جمع آوری شد. البته برخی از کشاورزان دوباره این لوله‌ها را مستقر کردند. برخی از آنها لوله‌هایی به طول ۵ کیلومتر کار گذاشته‌اند. ۳۰۰ هکتار از مزارع بوکان با فاضلاب آبیاری می‌شود. خروجی فاضلاب هزار لیتر بر ثانیه است و نیاز است دولت برای تصفیه خانه این شهر بودجه مجزایی در نظر بگیرد. اجازه تغییر کاربری نمی دهیم. آوات بازیار، رئیس اداره حفاظت محیط زیست بوکان: پس از جمع آوری لوله‌های برداشت غیر مجاز از فاضلاب با همکاری ادارات منابع آب، بهداشت و جهاد کشاورزی کارگروهی برای نظارت تشکیل شده است. تصفیه خانه بوکان کفاف پساب تولید شده را ندارد و با سرریز شدن به سیمینه رود می ریزد. سیمینه رود در نهایت به دریاچه ارومیه می‌رود. کشاورزان زیادی تمایل دارند که زمینهای دیم خود را به زمین آبی تبدیل کنند ولی برابر قانون تغییر کاربری اراضی و نحوه آبیاری ممنوع است و سازمان حفاظت

It has been confirmed that 319 farms have been reported to be infected in the southern Utrecht and northwestern Noord-Holland regions, where the outbreak occurred on a breeding farm. In this regard, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture recommends that the bluetongue virus is mainly spread by blood-sucking insects such as certain mosquitoes and that livestock can also be infected when moving around, so livestock should be kept in barns as much as possible at dusk when these insects are most active, and in case of an outbreak, It is stated that there is no cure other than general treatment methods, and the safety of the has not yet been verified. Veterinary experts point out that this infectious disease mainly affects sheep, goats, and cattle, and that unlike sheep, which can lead to death, in large livestock dairy cows, milk production drops sharply due to high fever and pain, and in feeder cattle, productivity decreases due to loss of appetite. there is.

423295919,"All the doctors were from the private sector, said the ministry on Tuesday (Oct 10), and the estimated amount that was inappropriately claimed is $400,000. These breaches were surfaced to the Claims Management Office (CMO) by whistleblowers or were picked up as outliers by the ministry's data analytics. The CMO, set up last October, then processes these cases to assess if the claims are appropriate. Some of the common errors found were the use of wrong surgical codes for claims, over-servicing of patients, and submission of claims not covered by MediShield Life, said MOH. One of the cases was a doctor who submitted an inflated claim for surgery to remove a tumour from a patient with stomach and intestinal cancer. That doctor had used multiple surgical codes during the claims process. The ministry said it is now looking at 70 more cases, and stepping up scrutiny of some doctors. This adjudication process under CMO is part of MOH's efforts to strengthen governance over inappropriate MediShield Life claims to ensure the long-term sustainability of MediShield Life funds to protect Singaporeans against large bills for medically necessary treatments. This process focuses on cases where complainants or whistleblowers have surfaced, as well as outliers picked up by the ministry's analytics. It is conducted by an independent panel appointed by the MediShield Life Council, and is comprised of relevant public and private sector specialists. To ensure objective decision-making, panel members are not identified, and the identities of doctors, patients and institutions are also removed. If the claim is found to be inappropriate, the doctor and the medical institution will be asked to rectify and refund the inappropriate portions of the claim and not recover the monies from the patient. MOH said that all providers were informed in October 2022 that different tiers of enforcement would take place for inappropriate claims filed after 1 April 2023. [[nid:532397]] Penalties can range from warnings to suspension of a provider's MediSave and MediShield Life accreditation. Cases that reflect potential misconduct and fraud will also be escalated to the Singapore Medical Council and police if needed. Patients whose MediShield Life claims have been adjudicated will be informed after the panel concludes its investigation. They will also be advised of any potential dispute channels for escalation, such as the clinical claims resolution process (CCRP) or the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE). Development of claims rules to guide medical practitioners Besides adjudication and enforcement, MOH has also rolled out claims rules to provide clarity on appropriate claims, and to allow doctors to clarify and rectify their practices. MOH said that it has currently has three sets of specialty-specific claims which have been developed by workgroups of private and public sector specialists — for gastrointestinal endoscopy, ear, nose and throat as well as cardiology. These claims rules cover high-volume surgical procedures, as well as those in which MOH has seen a certain degree of ambiguity. The health ministry shared that it intends to progressively expand the scope of claims rules to other disciplines. Current specialties that are not covered by claims rules will rely on existing measures that guide MediShield Claims.

423290003,"O feriado nacional de Nossa Senhora Aparecida está chegando e, com ele, a possibilidade de enfrentar as altas temperaturas com banhos de mar no litoral pernambucano. Para orientar a população sobre o melhor banho de mar e a forma mais segura de se refrescar na praia, o Comitê Estadual de Monitoramento aos Incidentes com Tubarões (Cemit) emitiu um alerta sobre cuidados. Para quem vai aproveitar o feriado no Litoral Sul de Pernambuco, é necessário saber que o trecho de 2,2 km da Praia de Piedade, entre a Igrejinha de Piedade e o Hotel Barramares , localizado ao lado do Hospital da Aeronáutica, tem proibição de banho de mar por conta de altas taxas de ataques de tubarão na área. Um trecho de 33 km, entre a Praia do Farol, em Olinda, até os coqueirais da Praia do Paiva, no Cabo de Santo Agostinho, é considerado um trecho de atenção para banhistas , que devem seguir as orientações dadas pelo Comitê (listadas abaixo). Segundo o Decreto estadual 21.402/1999, nesta área é proibida a prática de atividades náuticas. Segundo o Comitê, é importante que banhistas utilizem locais para banho em que a área seja protegida por recifes. 'Durante o feriadão teremos maré alta no período da tarde, entre 14h40 e 16h10, com amplitudes que variam de 2.1 a 2.3 metros. Pela manhã, entre 08h40 e 10h05 teremos marés baixas entre 0.2 e 0.4 metros, que são propícias para a formação de piscinas naturais, ou seja, com águas abrigadas pelos recifes. Nos trechos onde o mar é aberto - sem proteção dos recifes - é desaconselhável o banho de mar a qualquer hora do dia ou nível da maré', orientou o órgão. Entre os dias 12 e 14 de outubro, a lua estará na fase Minguante, período que geralmente apresenta marés de quadratura (ou marés mortas), com níveis de marés mais amenos e ondas fracas. No entanto, as marés serão similares às do dia 15, data que marca o início do período de Lua Nova. O Cemit orienta que, em época de luas cheia e nova, os banhistas não entrem no mar durante as marés cheias, pois o nível da água e as correntes marítimas ficam mais intensas, causando risco de incidentes com tubarão e afogamentos. Orientações do Comitê O BANHO DE MAR DEVE SER EVITADO: - Em áreas com placas de advertência de riscos de incidentes com tubarões; - Se estiver com algum tipo de ferida ou sangramento, pois fluidos sanguíneos podem ativar o olfato dos animais; - Durante períodos chuvosos, que aumentam a turbidez da água, fazendo com que os animais não diferenciam bem suas presas naturais de humanos. - Em locais próximos às desembocaduras de rios, pois os rios deságuam grandes quantidades de sedimentos e matéria orgânica no mar que, além de deixar a água turva, tende a atrair animais marinhos que podem oferecer riscos de incidentes. Além disso, essas regiões podem ser utilizadas como berçários de algumas espécies de tubarões; - Se tiver consumido bebida alcoólica; - Se estiver sozinho(a); - Se possuir objetivos brilhantes e chamativos, que podem aguçar os sentidos dos animais; Confira os horários das marés: Dia 12/10 (quinta-feira) 02h19 2.1m. 08h39 0.4m. 14h39 2.1m. 20h51 0.4m.

423294231,"Большинство типов боли можно облегчить с помощью анальгетиков, противовоспалительных препаратов или других рецептурных лекарств, но принимать их важно после консультации с врачом. Об этом «Ленте.ру» рассказал главный внештатный специалист Депздрава Москвы по первичной медико-санитарной помощи Врач предупредил, что от обезболивающих препаратов может развиться зависимость, особенно при неправильном или чрезмерном использовании. «Это означает, что человеку может потребоваться все больше и больше препарата, чтобы достичь того же эффекта, и при отмене могут возникать неприятные физические симптомы. Возможно развитие и психологической зависимости, когда человек начинает использовать обезболивающие для снятия эмоционального дискомфорта или стресса. Это может привести к тому, что он будет испытывать сильное желание употреблять препарат даже при отсутствии физической необходимости», — поделился он. Поэтому к вопросу приема препаратов необходимо подходить осознано и ответственно. Лучше для начала проконсультироваться с врачом, который посоветует подходящие препарат, определит дозу и срок приема. Также, со слов собеседника «Ленты.ру», многие обезболивающие препараты не рекомендуется принимать в течение продолжительного времени. Дело в том, что при бесконтрольном приеме лекарства могут ухудшать состояние слизистой желудка и кишечника, приводить к гастритам, нарушать работу печени, способствовать накоплению токсинов в организме, появлению дерматитов и аллергий, могут провоцировать образование тромбов, ухудшение зрения и другие негативные последствия. Если боль не проходит, становится регулярной или хронической, Тяжельников посоветовал обратиться к врачу и подобрать лечение или альтернативные методы для снятия боли.

423293676,"Вздутие живота проблема нередкая и при этом дискомфортная для человека. Но, как правило, ее рассматривают как временную и совершенно не опасную для здоровья. На деле, отмечают специалисты, такая проблема не так проста, как кажется. Чем же может быть опасно вздутие живота и что делать, если оно появляется регулярно, aif.ru рассказал врач высшей категории, д. м. н., заведующий отделением абдоминальной хирургии и онкологии ФГБНУ Российский научный центр хирургии им. акад. Б. В. Петровского, хирург-онколог, колопроктолог Аркадий Беджанян. Под вздутием живота понимают состояние, когда область талии начинает увеличиваться, приобретает выпуклость впереди или превращается в более надутую в сравнении с обычным состоянием. Причин для появления такого симптома довольно много, при этом вздутие может быть разной степени тяжести. Также оно бывает кратковременным, а иногда отмечается на регулярной основе и сигнализирует о серьезных медицинских проблемах. В числе причин, по которым развивается вздутие: Газообразование оно развивается на фоне нарушения пищеварения, когда в кишечнике или желудке начинают скапливаться газы. Синдром раздраженного кишечника такое состояние относится к хроническим, обычно вздутие при нем дополняется и другими не менее дискомфортными симптомами: болями в животе, диареей и запорами. Пищевая непереносимость например, вздутие может быть ярким признаком лактазной недостаточности или при неусвоении организмом глютена. Запор из-за проблем с прохождением стула по кишечнику газы могут начать накапливаться в нем. Избыток в рационе алкоголя или газировок (так называемых содовых) здесь, скорее, речь о временном вздутии. Повышенное образование газов такая ситуация происходит в ответ на неконтролируемое заглатывание воздуха. Медицинские проблемы различные патологии, которые приводят к затруднению работы кишечника, например, опухолях, воспалительным процессам, инфекциям желудка и кишечника и многие другие. Беременность увеличение матки по мере роста плода становятся причиной сдавливания соседних органов, в том числе и кишечника. Нередко кажется, что проблема временная. Однако, если вздутие дополняется симптомами или начинает проявляться регулярно, то стоит обратиться к врачу. В какие моменты может возникать вздутие? Нередко проявляет себя такой симптом крайне невовремя. Оно может отмечаться: После еды в этом случае причиной могут быть функциональные нарушения пищеварения или из-за слишком быстрого поедания продуктов. После физической активности интенсивные упражнения, приводящие к изменению кровотока в зоне брюшной полости могут стать причиной сбоя. На фоне стресса нервное перенапряжение может негативно сказываться на состоянии кишечника. Стоит обращать внимание, когда именно у вас чаще всего проявляет себя такой симптом это поможет врачу при диагностике. Опасно ли вздутие живота? Само по себе такое состояние, как правило, не вредно. Например, если вызвано физической активностью и сохраняется временно. Но все же и игнорировать ситуацию не стоит. Обязательно надо смотреть на следующие факторы, чтобы понять, когда вздутие сигнализирует серьезную патологию. Итак, следите за: Длительностью проявления и степенью выраженности: если живот раздувает длительное время, при этом объем его увеличивается ощутимо, то это может быть указанием на опухоль. Наличием дополнительных симптомов: если кроме самого вздутия есть боли, рвота, проблемы со стулом, потеря веса, то ждать не стоит это может указывать на болезни пищеварительной системы, воспалениях или даже онкологические заболевания. Историей своих болезней: если уже известно о наличии проблемы с ЖКТ или подтверждены иные медицинские патологии (к примеру, непереносимость глютена), вздутие живота может быть связано с ними и требует особого пристального внимания. Течение беременности: несмотря на то, что такой симптом у беременных это вариант нормы, он тоже может стать патологическим. Например, вздутие иногда развивается на фоне осложнений беременности. Если вздутие живота беспокоит человека, то врач предложит обследование, в рамках которого возьмет анализы крови, проведет УЗИ и другие исследования по необходимости. Самое главное вовремя обратиться к специалисту. Как справляться со вздутием? Конечно же, когда живот буквально раздувает, очень хочется что-то с этим сделать. Есть ряд общих советов, которые позволят минимизировать столь неприятное ощущение: Старайтесь избегать быстрого приема пищи, когда продукты буквально заглатываются, не жуя. Также опасно и переедание. Надо тщательно и медленно пережевывать пищу, ведь в противном случае вы сами провоцируете газообразование. Пересмотрите рацион и исключите те продукты, которые способствуют избытку газов. Чаще всего таким эффектом отличаются капуста, брокколи, фасоль, лук и газировки. Новые продукты в свой рацион вводите постепенно. Если вы сразу же съедите полный стол новой для себя еды, то потом будет сложно выявить, на что отреагировал организм. Особенно важно это в отношении продуктов, богатых клетчаткой. Следите за своей позой во время приема пищи: сидеть нужно ровно, ноги скрещивать нельзя эта простая рекомендация позволит предотвратить заглатывание воздуха. Уделите внимание правильным упражнениям даже небольшая физнагрузка улучшает пищеварение, также с ее помощью можно снизить вздутие, если отнестись к тренировке с умом. Пейте достаточное количество воды она помогает правильному пищеварению и очищает организм от токсинов, которые могут вредить желудку и кишечнику.

423289707,"He told the teen she should model, she said; she denied Greenspan’s suggestion that she was flattered. 'He was very old,' she said of the then-65-year-old. Now 82, Nygard has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting her and four other women in his Toronto bedroom suite and to one count of forcible confinement during incidents spanning the late 1980s to 2005. Poised and steadfast, the attractive 35-year-old — who is part of a class-action lawsuit against Nygard in the U.S. — recounted a harrowing night that took a dark turn when she said the men started discussing her vagina. Nygard announced that he really needed to see it, she testified, and started to pull up her skirt. She later told police she playfully tried to push him away and her 'body language' told him no. 'Let him, let him,' her date insisted. 'Because I had a penis in my mouth,' she said bitterly. The next thing she said she remembers is throwing up in his bathroom and Nygard knocking on the door, telling her the condom was still inside her. She fished it out with disgust, she recalled, and then continued to vomit. The other woman helped clean her up and get her dressed and then gave her pills she said would make her feel better. The next day, she said, the woman called and told her to take more pills she’d put in her pocket — pills she’d later believe to be morning-after contraception. She said she woke the next morning in her bed, smelling of vomit, her body aching, her makeup smeared. She said she felt 'really used,' but didn’t tell anyone. 'It is difficult to rationalize what a 16-year-old is thinking, but I can tell you I thought that I somehow did something wrong,' she struggled to explain. 'I went somewhere I wasn’t supposed to, I lied to my parents about where I was going.' It took her 16 years to lay the blame elsewhere.

423287549,به گزارش گروه اجتماعی ایسکانیوز، شادی و رضایت از زندگی هرچند یک احساس و گاهی نوعی انتخاب و حتی سبک زندگی است؛ اما تغذیه هم در آن بی‌تاثیر نیست. سروتونین، یک پیام‌رسان شیمیایی است که دانشمندان معتقدند می‌تواند به‌عنوان تنظیم‌کننده خُلق‌وخو عمل کند. همچنین گفته می‌شود که سروتونین به الگوی خواب سالم و افزایش میزان شادمانی هم کمک می‌کند. بیشتر بخوانید: خلاصه این ماده شیمیایی غالباً با ایجاد احساسات مطلوب و زندگی طولانی‌تر در ارتباط است. اگر بخواهید به‌طور طبیعی و بدون نیاز به مکمل‌ها، سطح سروتونین را در بدن افزایش دهید، می‌توانید مواد غذایی حاوی تریپتوفان را بیشتر مصرف کنید؛ چراکه سروتونین از ترکیب با تریپتوفان تشکیل می‌شود. تحقیقات نشان می‌دهد در افرادی که دچار اختلالات خُلقی مثل افسردگی یا اضطراب هستند، کمبود تریپتوفان دیده می‌شود. در این مطلب، با چند ماده غذایی و دیگر روش‌هایی که می‌توانید به کمک آن‌ها سطح سروتونین مغز را بالا ببرید آشنا می‌شوید: مواد غذایی که سروتونین را افزایش می‌دهند. تخم‌مرغ| پروتئین موجود در تخم‌مرغ می‌تواند سطح تریپتوفان پلاسمای خون شما را به میزان قابل توجهی افزایش دهد. زرده تخم مرغ، سرشار از تریپتوفان، تیروزین، کولین، بیوتین، اسیدهای چرب امگا3 به علاوه سایر مواد مغذی مفید برای سلامت بدن و همچنین دارای خواص آنتی اکسیدانی است. پنیر| پنیرها، یکی دیگر از منابع عالی تریپتوفان هستند. پنیرهای پارمزان یا چدار، از انواع خوشمزه و محبوب پنیرها هستند که در پخت‌وپز و تهیه غذاهایی مثل ماکارونی، پاستا، لازانیا و ... هم استفاده می‌شوند. آناناس| آناناس منبع آنزیم بروملین است. این آنزیم، در واقع پروتئینی است که می‌تواند عوارض جانبی شیمی درمانی و همچنین سرفه‌های مزمن را کاهش دهد و از طرفی با ترکیباتی که دارد سطح سروتونین مغز را بالا ببرد. سالمون| ماهی سالمون منبعی غنی از تریپتوفان است. این ماهی همچنین دارای فواید تغذیه‌ای دیگری همچون کاهش کلسترول و فشار خون است و منبع خوبی هم برای اسیدهای چرب امگا 3 به شمار می‌رود. آجیل و دانه‌های روغنی| از آنجا که تمام آجیل‌ها و مغزجات حاوی تریپتوفان هستند، می‌توانید هر نوع آجیلی را که بیشتر دوست دارید، برای مصرف روزانه انتخاب کنید. تحقیقات نشان داده است که مصرف روزانه یک مشت آجیل، می‌تواند شما را از خطر ابتلا به سرطان، بیماری‌های قلبی و مشکلات تنفسی تا حد زیادی مصون نگه دارد. تریپوفان چه‌طور سروتونین تولید می‌کند؟ سروتونین را نمی‌توان در مواد غذایی جست‌وجو کرد؛ اما تریپتوفان در غذاهای مختلف یافت می‌شود. مواد غذایی حاوی پروتئین، آهن، ریبوفلاوین (ویتامین b2) و ویتامین b6، همگی دارای مقدار زیادی از این نوع آمینو اسید هستند. در حالی که مواد غذایی حاوی تریپتوفان به خودی خود نمی توانند سطح سروتونین را افزایش دهند، اما به کمک یک تقلب ساده این کار را انجام می دهند! به کمک کربوهیدرات‌ها. کربوهیدرات‌ها باعث می‌شوند که بدن انسولین بیشتری آزاد کند. همین امر جذب اسید آمینه تریپتوفان را بالا برده، آن را در خون آزاد می‌کند. بنابراین اگر مواد غذایی حاوی تریپتوفان را با کربوهیدرات‌هایی مثل مثل جو دوسر، برنج و نان‌های سبوس‌دار (حاوی غلات کامل) ترکیب کنید، می‌توانید سطح سروتونین را افزایش دهید. روش‌های دیگر برای بالا بردن میزان سروتونین. ورزش کردن| مطالعاتی که در بریتانیا صورت گرفته است، نشان می‌دهد که ورزش منظم می‌تواند تاثیرات ضد افسردگی داشته باشد. نور خورشید| نور درمانی، روشی رایج برای درمان افسردگی فصلی است. تحقیقات نشان می‌دهد که بین قرار گرفتن در معرض نور خورشید و افزایش سطح سروتونین، رابطه‌ای مستقیم وجود دارد. برای داشتن خواب بهتر و برای بهبود خُلق و خو، سعی کنید روزانه برای ساعاتی در فضای باز و پر نور پیاده‌روی کنید. باکتری روده| سعی کنید یک رژیم‌های پُر فیبر را دنبال کنید که می‌تواند باعث تحریک باکتری‌های روده شود. تحقیقات جدید نشان می‌دهد که این باکتری‌ها می‌توانند از طریق محور روده‌ای مغزی، در میزان سروتونین نقش داشته باشند. انتهای پیام/,9578,به گزارش گروه اجتماعی ایسکانیوز شادی و رضایت از زندگی هرچند یک احساس و گاهی نوعی انتخاب و حتی سبک زندگی است اما تغذیه هم در آن نیست سروتونین یک شیمیایی است که دانشمندان معتقدند عمل کند همچنین گفته که سروتونین به الگوی خواب سالم و افزایش میزان شادمانی هم کمک بیشتر بخوانید خلاصه این ماده شیمیایی با ایجاد احساسات مطلوب و زندگی در ارتباط است اگر بخواهید طبیعی و بدون نیاز به سطح سروتونین را در بدن افزایش دهید مواد غذایی حاوی تریپتوفان را بیشتر مصرف کنید چراکه سروتونین از ترکیب با تریپتوفان تشکیل تحقیقات نشان در افرادی که دچار اختلالات مثل افسردگی یا اضطراب هستند کمبود تریپتوفان دیده در این مطلب با چند ماده غذایی و دیگر که به کمک سطح سروتونین مغز را بالا ببرید آشنا مواد غذایی که سروتونین را افزایش پروتئین موجود در سطح تریپتوفان پلاسمای خون شما را به میزان قابل توجهی افزایش دهد زرده تخم مرغ سرشار از تریپتوفان تیروزین کولین بیوتین اسیدهای چرب به علاوه سایر مواد مغذی مفید برای سلامت بدن و همچنین دارای خواص آنتی اکسیدانی است پنیرها یکی دیگر از منابع عالی تریپتوفان هستند پنیرهای پارمزان یا چدار از انواع خوشمزه و محبوب پنیرها هستند که در و تهیه غذاهایی مثل ماکارونی پاستا لازانیا و هم استفاده آناناس منبع آنزیم بروملین است این آنزیم در واقع پروتئینی است که عوارض جانبی شیمی درمانی و همچنین مزمن را کاهش دهد و از طرفی با ترکیباتی که دارد سطح سروتونین مغز را بالا ببرد ماهی سالمون منبعی غنی از تریپتوفان است این ماهی همچنین دارای فواید دیگری همچون کاهش کلسترول و فشار خون است و منبع خوبی هم برای اسیدهای چرب امگا به شمار آجیل و از آنجا که تمام و مغزجات حاوی تریپتوفان هستند هر نوع آجیلی را که بیشتر دوست دارید برای مصرف روزانه انتخاب کنید تحقیقات نشان داده است که مصرف روزانه یک مشت آجیل شما را از خطر ابتلا به سرطان قلبی و مشکلات تنفسی تا حد زیادی مصون نگه دارد تریپوفان سروتونین تولید سروتونین را در مواد غذایی کرد اما تریپتوفان در غذاهای مختلف یافت مواد غذایی حاوی پروتئین آهن ریبوفلاوین ویتامین و ویتامین همگی دارای مقدار زیادی از این نوع آمینو اسید هستند در حالی که مواد غذایی حاوی تریپتوفان به خودی خود نمی توانند سطح سروتونین را افزایش دهند اما به کمک یک تقلب ساده این کار را انجام می دهند به کمک باعث که بدن انسولین بیشتری آزاد کند همین امر جذب اسید آمینه تریپتوفان را بالا برده آن را در خون آزاد بنابراین اگر مواد غذایی حاوی تریپتوفان را با مثل مثل جو دوسر برنج و حاوی غلات کامل ترکیب کنید سطح سروتونین را افزایش دهید دیگر برای بالا بردن میزان سروتونین ورزش مطالعاتی که در بریتانیا صورت گرفته است نشان که ورزش منظم تاثیرات ضد افسردگی داشته باشد نور نور درمانی روشی رایج برای درمان افسردگی فصلی است تحقیقات نشان که بین قرار گرفتن در معرض نور خورشید و افزایش سطح سروتونین مستقیم وجود دارد برای داشتن خواب بهتر و برای بهبود و خو سعی کنید روزانه برای ساعاتی در فضای باز و پر نور کنید باکتری سعی کنید یک فیبر را دنبال کنید که باعث تحریک روده شود تحقیقات جدید نشان که این از طریق محور مغزی در میزان سروتونین نقش داشته باشند انتهای
423288202,"A Northland beef cattle farmer has been fined $30,000 for failing to provide adequate feed for nearly 400 animals. Jeffrey Allan Wood (69) pleaded guilty to six charges under the Animal Welfare Act and was sentenced yesterday in the Whangarei District Court, following a successful prosecution by the Ministry for Primary Industries. MPI Animal Welfare Inspectors found 387 cattle in poor physical health because of a chronic lack of grass, and a lack of supplementary feed, says MPI Acting National Manager of Animal Welfare and NAIT Compliance, Brendon Mikkelsen. 'Most farmers do the right thing and Mr Wood is an experienced farmer and knew what he needed to do to feed and provide for the welfare of his animals.' 'These animals were thin and fell well below meeting the standard of the Sheep and Beef cattle Code of Welfare.' Following a complaint from a veterinarian in July 2020, MPI sent Animal Welfare Inspectors to Mr Wood’s Ruawai farm to inspect his animals, through a series of visits until October 2020. In total 840 of his animals were examined. Some animals were affected by bad diarrhoea and emaciated. In one case, when Mr Wood was directed to euthanise a severely lame young bull to mitigate its suffering, MPI found it still had not been done a week later, which Mr Wood claimed was because he could not find the animal. 'These animals were suffering, and Mr Wood’s delayed action prolonged their suffering. He failed to meet the physical, health and behavioural needs of these animals. When we find evidence that animal welfare has been neglected, if appropriate - we will place the matter before the Court,' says Brendon Mikkelsen. Along with the fine, Mr Wood was also ordered to pay $2834.80 in veterinarian expenses and $6057.97 in farmer consultant fees.

423289051,"A Queensland mum whose four-year-old daughter is in hospital with meningococcal says lesions on her body 'spread like wildfire'. Lockyer Valley woman Alana Fairclough’s daughter Skyla is recovering having woken up from an induced coma in Brisbane ’s Queensland Children’s Hospital (QCH) after falling severely ill on Thursday last week. She said Skyla first showed signs of illness the previous day when she woke up from a nap with a fever and vomited. She was also 'very lethargic and sleepy' and 'became quite sore all over her body', while Panadol failed to break the fever, according to Fairclough. 'Something didn’t feel right, so I put us all in the car and headed to the closest hospital,' she said on Facebook , in a series of posts shared by 7NEWS.com.au with permission. 'After quite a long wait she proceeded to vomit again. I was told it was a viral infection, keep doing what I was doing and we were sent home.' About 11.30pm, Skyla began 'screaming' and was on the floor in her room when her mum reached her. 'She was extremely delusional, weak (and) couldn’t sit on her own or stand,' Fairclough said. 'Her arms were on and off shaking.' It was when Fairclough decided to give Skyla a bath that she 'noticed the oddly shaped purple spots'. She called healthdirect, where a nurse called an ambulance for Skyla. Paramedics gave her antibiotics 'in our driveway', said Fairclough, before rushing her to QCH. Alana Fairclough said Skyla initially fell ill with a fever. Credit: Supplied. In the hospital, the spots — a common symptom of meningococcal — 'started to spread like wildfire'. 'We were told that things would get really bad before they get better but that never prepared me for what would happen next,' Fairclough said. 'Her blood pressure became very unstable, she was extremely irritated and her oxygen levels started to decline.' When Skyla’s blood pressure dropped, 'I was rushed out, many doctors raced in and we sat outside of her room howling as my little girl was then to be incubated', she said. Skyla was 'very unstable for quite a while' but eventually showed signs of improvement as doctors 'continued pumping her with all the good stuff to help her fight this horrible infection, alongside her being incredibly strong'. The purple lesions on Skyla spread like ‘wildfire’. Credit: Supplied. On Saturday, the day before Skyla’s fourth birthday, Fairclough reported her daughter was 'doing really well'. 'Amazing nurses' at the hospital decorated her room and played her favourite music, while there was also good news for her health. 'Skyla was able to come off all blood pressure and heart medication and began the weaning stage from her paralysis and sedation (medication),' Fairclough said. 'Throughout the day she would occasionally move her limbs and flutter her beautiful blue eyes. A photo posted by the mum on Wednesday showed Skyla cracking a smile. Credit: Supplied. An update on Wednesday showed a photo of Skyla smiling as she remains covered in lesions in the paediatric intensive care unit. 'Skyla, you are one strong girl,' said Fairclough.

423290907,"Beginning with Carrauntoohil in Kerry on October 14, Arklow native George Horsman will summit Mweelrea in Mayo and Slieve Donard in Down before finishing in Wicklow with Lugnaquilla, with all proceeds from the fundraising challenge going to Arklow Cancer Support, Headway Ireland, the Beaumont Hospital Foundation, Breast Cancer Ireland and the Irish Cancer Society. In March 2018, George's life was flipped upside down when he was diagnosed with a Grade-4 pineoblastoma, a tumour of the pineal gland in the brain, just two months shy of graduating college and starting his professional career. An eager and attentive student, George had to drop out of college to start his cancer treatment, which included a gruelling combination of brain surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 'I started getting headaches at the beginning of February, but being young and focusing on my final year of college, I brushed them off as nothing,' George began. 'It wasn't until the point where the headaches were so painful that I was up all night vomiting because of the pain that I finally got an MRI in March. 'I went to my GP a few days later, where I was diagnosed with tension headaches, and as he was giving me that diagnosis, he got a call from the MRI people who informed him of the results of my MRI – I had a 3cm large brain tumour on my pineal gland. 'I immediately admitted myself to Beaumont Hospital, where I had two surgeries to relieve the pressure build-up in my brain and underwent a biopsy. 'Because of my age and other characteristics, it was initially thought that the tumour was going to be a Grade 1 Glioma. Later, I got my tumour diagnosis, where my neurosurgeon gave me the unanticipated diagnosis of a Grade 4 Pineoblastoma. 'This tumour is typically diagnosed in children, and the oldest person to get diagnosed with it before in Ireland was 13, which is why it was so unexpected.' George had surgery to remove the tumour soon thereafter, with the neurosurgeon successfully removing 80 per cent of it. His next course of treatment started in April, comprising six weeks of radiotherapy, five days per week, along with a range of chemotherapy drugs. 'The radiotherapy took a huge toll on my brain and body, and once this course of treatment elapsed, I was like a walking zombie,' George continued. 'My CLV Treatment (Cisplatin, Lomustine and Vincristine) were a combination of three chemotherapy drugs, two intravenous and one oral. This block of treatment was to be done in 8 cycles, so 48 weeks of chemotherapy. 'My first block of treatment was very rough, and I ended up being dreadfully sick and having to be admitted to hospital for a few days for observation. 'By October, I had completed three cycles of chemotherapy and was due to have my first MRI since my brain surgeries. It felt like a life-or-death situation, and the anxiety while waiting for the MRI results was unbearable. 'I was over the moon to hear that the scan was clear, and I can't put into words how relieved I was. I celebrated with my family and friends, and it felt surreal to hear what I had been praying for. 'That high lasted about a week, and despite the news being amazing it caused my fight-or-flight instincts to deactivate, and the gravity of what I had gone through hit me like a truck. 'I still had seven more months of chemotherapy ahead of me, and while it was great that the cancer was gone, it was tough having to continue the treatment while coming to terms with it all. 'In January 2019, I got more good news. The doctors were happy with how my treatment was going and decided to reduce the number of cycles from 8 to 6, enabling me to finish three months earlier than planned. 'This allowed me to start planning my recovery and focus on positives such as getting back to good health and returning to college. I finished my chemotherapy on February 21.' George spent the remainder of the year getting back to good health, dealing with the side effects of his treatment and preparing to return to university. With only the second semester of the final year of his degree to complete, the university allowed him to sit in semester one classes to get acclimatised to being a student again. Returning to studies was difficult for George, as the radiotherapy treatment had left him with a brain injury that severely affected his short-term memory. Due to the social distancing implementation in 2020 and university courses going online, final year exams were replaced with assignments, which George said worked in his favour and aided him in graduating with a first-class honours. Having secured his first job with Ryanair shortly thereafter, George went on to work in Eirtrade before landing his current post at Pfizer in Dublin. With his life now firmly back on track, George said that he felt the time was right to give back to those who helped him get through his cancer journey. 'I have received so much support on my cancer journey, and I have always felt a great desire to give back, and the five charities I am raising money for mean so much to me,' George said. 'Headway Ireland has supported me with my brain injury that the radiotherapy left me with and coming to terms with my other treatment-related problems. 'They provided me with a neuropsychologist to help me with my problems that I have seen for over three years. They also did a cognitive function report to assess the impact of the injury and how I can manage it in my day-to-day life and at work. Headway has been vital for my post-cancer rehabilitation. 'Arklow Cancer Support has been by my side since day one. As soon as I got the news that I had a brain tumour, I went round the corner of my GP to their building and made contact. They provided me with lifts to and from my hospital appointments, waiting for me while I did my treatment. 'This was especially important during my radiotherapy appointments, which were every weekday, as I was nowhere near healthy or strong enough to get public transport to those radiotherapy sessions. They provided me with advice and support and continue to this day. 'Beaumont Hospital is where I got all my brain surgeries and chemotherapy, and I still regularly go for check-ups for all my post-treatment-related problems. I know most people dislike going to hospitals, but Beaumont almost feels like a home away from home. I went through so much with them as an in-patient, and they continue to provide me with out-patient care. 'The Irish Cancer Society is the largest cancer resource for people and I've learned so much about cancer and cancer-related information through their resources and the information and support they provide to help not just the cancer patient but the whole family and friends going through the journey by their sides. 'Although the Breast Cancer Society never provided me with treatment for my cancer, they are very dear to my heart and a charity that cannot get enough support. 'When I was going through my chemotherapy, I sat in the oncology ward awaiting my treatment and was shocked to see that one third of the people around me were women with breast cancer. This really stuck with me – cancer is cruel. 'I truly appreciate every bit of support for giving back to the charities that mean so much to me,' George added. 'If you aren't able to donate, even sharing the fundraiser would be greatly appreciated. 'If you would like to join me on any of these hikes, please reach out to me and let me know, as the support would really help. The more people, the merrier!'

(EFE/EPA/ALI HAIDER) Por Redacción octubre 10, 2023 | 19:50 pm hrs El fin de semana pasado fue complicado para los pilotos de Fórmula 1, durante el Gran Premio de Qatar . Esta fue una carrera atípica gracias a las condiciones que había en el circuito de Losail. Vómitos, desmayos, deshidratación y golpes de calor fueron solo algunas de las condiciones a las que se enfrentaron los corredores. Más de uno habló sobre lo que experimentó en las 57 vueltas de Qatar con excepción de Logan Sargeant , quien corrió solo 42, ya que tuvo que salir por cuestiones de salud. ¿Qué pasó en el GP de Qatar? De acuerdo con el sitio The Race las temperaturas oscilaban entre 60 a 80 grados dentro de la cabina de pilotos en los monoplazas , aunado a que Losail es un circuito con curvas de alta velocidad, lo que fue un factor importante a la hora de correr. Incluso, la FIA emitió un comunicado admitiendo que hubo condiciones que provocaron ciertas anomalías en la carrera del domingo, por lo que revisarán cuidadosamente que no vuelva a ocurrir.

(Foto: Captura de pantalla) 'Aunque sean atletas de élite, no se debe esperar que compitan en condiciones que puedan poner en peligro su salud o seguridad (…) la FIA tomará todas las medidas razonables para establecer y comunicar parámetros aceptables en que se celebran las competencias', decía el comunicado. Aunado a las altas temperaturas, la humedad en Qatar estaba por encima del promedio , además de que la pista y dichas condiciones no permitía a los pilotos dar más de 18 vueltas con los mismos neumáticos, lo que entorpecía algunas maniobras. Pilotos hablan sobre cómo experimentaron el GP de Qatar. Si bien la FIA es un organismo con autoridad para hablar de lo ocurrido en Qatar, lo cierto es que solo los pilotos pueden compartir su experiencia corriendo en la pista y los diferentes efectos que esta les provocó. Uno de ellos fue Esteban Ocon , quien dijo sentirse mal durante las vueltas 15 y 16 al punto de vomitar en su monoplaza durante la carrera. Estuve vomitando durante dos vueltas dentro del cockpit , y entonces pensé: ‘Mierda, va a ser una carrera muy larga’ (…) Hacía tanto calor que quería abrir la visera en la recta, porque no tenía aire , e intentaba también guiar un poco de aire hacia el casco con la mano', explicó el francés. Esteban Ocon la pasó mal en el GP de Qatar. (Foto: Facebook / Esteban Ocon) 'Cuanto más respiraba para intentar que todo bajara, más calor entraba dentro del casco. Sinceramente, era un infierno ahí dentro ', agregó el piloto de Quien también compartió con algunos medios la forma en que vivió la carrera fue Valtteri Bottas , quien dijo que la carrera fue más complicada para él por las altas temperaturas. 'Yo diría que más dura que la de Singapur. Solo la temperatura en el cockpit parece ser casi demasiado, como si estuviera llegando al límite de que alguien va a tener un golpe de calor (…) La sensación es como una tortura en el coche . Con más calor ya no sería seguro', explicó el finlandés. , además de hablar sobre las altas temperaturas en Losail, también compartió que la falta de agua también influyó en su desempeño. 'Es solo que la deshidratación es de tal nivel que tu visión es mucho peor , tu ritmo cardíaco va a las estrellas, y es muy difícil controlar todo esto. Así que fue muy, muy difícil', explicó el monegasco. Charles Leclerc habló sobre lo complicado que fue el GP de Qatar 2023. (Foto: EFE) ¿Qué medidas tomará la FIA para evitar que vuelva a pasar lo del GP de Qatar? Las condiciones climáticas en Qatar, que combinaban altas temperaturas con humedad influyeron para que prácticamente todos los pilotos se sintieran mal durante la carrera, provocando incluso abandonos como el de Sargeant. Al respecto, la FIA explicó que ya empezó a analizar la situación en Qatar para poder dar mejores recomendaciones en condiciones climáticas extremas, como en este caso lo fueron el calor y la humedad. Entre los puntos que trataría el organismo 'pueden incluir orientación para los competidores, investigación sobre modificaciones para un flujo de aire más eficiente en la cabina y recomendaciones para cambios en el calendario para alinearlo con condiciones climáticas aceptables, entre otras', explica el documento citado por The Race Las condiciones climáticas de Qatar el 8 de octubre complicaron la carrera en Losail. (EFE) Experto habla sobre decisión de la FIA. De acuerdo con la publicación, las medidas no solo deben ser tomadas en cuenta en climas como lluvia extrema, también con calor y humedad considerables para evitar que ocurra lo del domingo pasado otra vez. probablemente esquivó un poco, si alguien se hubiera desmayado conduciendo, obviamente habría sido horrible', dijo el Dr. Chris Tyler de la Universidad de Roehampton en Londres, quien ha ayudado a los pilotos de McLaren con sus entrenamientos. 'Definitivamente se ha pasado por alto (el calor), pero ahora es un buen momento para abordarlo, ya que hay muchas carreras calientes.

423319046,"The fight, which happened in the early hours on February 4, was between two groups of people outside The Haystack Pub. Matt had been at the pub, where he previously also worked as a doorman, and saw the fight taking place. Essex Police said a friend went over to try and intervene but was then assaulted, at which point Matt went over to help him. One group - consisting of a man and woman - got into a vehicle and left. READ MORE: READ MORE: 'Hugely popular' Essex race car driver Dan Kirby died after being found unresponsive at Chelmsford home Jamie Lewis, 24, from the other group, pushed Matt up against a hoarding and stabbed him, Essex Police said. A trial at Basildon Crown Court was told that no one saw the exact moment Mr Portwood was stabbed, nor did anyone witness a knife. The prosecution said, however, that it was 'undeniable' that he sustained two stab wounds which caused a 'catastrophic loss of blood'. He was pronounced dead at 2.44am. After fatally wounding Mr Portwood, Lewis attempted to go back into The Haystack with his clothes covered in blood. Inside, he tried to buy a drink and later was seen ordering a kebab. Jamie Lewis has been convicted of murder at Basildon Crown Court (Image: Essex Police) In a statement, Matt’s family thanked Essex Police for their work 'to help bring justice for Matt'. They added: 'We will never heal from our loss of Matt or from the trauma that we have endured. The children will never get their daddy back, a loss of a son and a brother, but we will hold on to the memories we have and that Matt's spirit will always live on with the children.' Matt’s parents, who also thanked detectives for 'allowing some measure of closure', added: 'The death of Matthew had a traumatic effect on his parents and sisters, and this is something that they will live with forever.' Detective Inspector Kev Hughes of Essex Police said: 'The evidence demonstrated Matt and his friend were trying to act as peacemakers and, tragically, this has cost Matt his life. His attacker has shown no remorse for taking his life and, shockingly, seemed very comfortable with the extreme levels of violence involved in the assault on Matt. 'The team worked tirelessly, to secure the evidence in the case and to deliver Matt and his family justice. Lewis will now face a significant custodial sentence and while no conviction or term of imprisonment will ever bring Matt back, I hope this, and passage of time will help them to move forward.'

423320214,"Paní Stanislava (54) ze Zlína dostala cuketu vypěstovanou na zahrádce a řekla si, že by si ji mohla připravit k večeři zapečenou s rajčaty a sýrem. Jak popsal portál iDnes , který o případu jako první informoval, to ještě nemohla tušit, co ji čeká. 'Jídlo jsem jedla s chutí, ale po snězení asi dvou třetin se mi chuť začala zdát podivně nahořklá. Bohužel jsem jídlo celé dojedla,' přiblížila paní Stanislava. A po několika hodinách to začalo. Napřed bolesti břicha, pak obrovské křeče a nakonec narůžovělý vodnatý průjem. Po několika hodinách se to už nedalo vydržet a obrátila se na lékaře ze zlínské nemocnice Tomáše Bati. 'Její stav byl opravdu dramatický. Začali jsme podávat infuze, provedlo se CT břicha, kde byl popsán obraz těžkého otoku sliznice žaludku, tlustého střeva a výrazné změny na játrech. Výrazné poškození jater bylo patrné i z krevních testů. Pacientka pak byla ze zvracení a průjmů tak vyčerpaná, až na chvíli ztratila vědomí,' popsal pro iDnes lékař Ilja Ryšavý. ​Lékaři si zpočátku nebyli úplně jistí, o co se jedná, paní Stanislavě nasadili širokospektrální antibiotika. 'Musím říci, že do té doby jsem nikdy o intoxikaci hořkou cuketou neslyšel. Ale protože nám pak pacientka o konzumaci cukety řekla, naše sestřičky napadlo, jestli se nemohla tímto způsobem otrávit. Skutečně jsme pak našli v internetové databázi několik popisů podobných případů otrav, které vznikly po požití tykvovité zeleniny s obsahem cucurbitacinu, což nám potvrdili odborníci z toxikologického informačního střediska ve VFN Praha s tím, že se však nikdy nejednalo o takto závažnou otravu,' dodal Ryšavý. Cucurbitacin je toxická biochemická sloučenina, kterou obsahují některé rostliny a která slouží jako ochrana před býložravci. V některých rostlinách, jako právě u cuket či okurek, může tuto sloučeninu prozradit hořká příchuť. Paní Stanislava zůstala nakonec v nemocnici šest dní. 'Zásadním poučením asi je, aby lidé kousek takové zeleniny ochutnali již před případnou tepelnou úpravou a v žádném případě ji nekonzumovali v případě hořké nebo jinak podivné chuti,' poradil Ryšavý.

Il motivo del richiamo è un rischio microbiologico, più precisamente la sospetta presenza di Escherichia coli produttori di Shiga-tossina STEC (sierogruppo O-157). Cosa fare. Le forme di formaggio da 6 chili e mezzo, contrassegnate con il numero di lotto indicato, ovvero 3 luglio 2023, vanno restituire al produttore.

Gli Escherichia coli (E. coli) sono dei batteri che si trovano naturalmente nell’ambiente, negli alimenti e nell’intestino delle persone e degli animali. La maggior parte di questi batteri sono innocui. Ma alcuni possono causare gravi forme di malattia nell’uomo. Ad esempio, gli Escherichia coli produttori di Shiga-tossina STEC. L'infezione provocata da questa tipologia di batterio può causare diarrea, spesso con presenza di sangue), crampi allo stomaco, nausea e vomito. I sintomi dell' intossicazione alimentare compaiono dopo 3 o 4 giorni da quando si è mangiato l’alimento contaminato. La maggior parte delle persone infette migliora da sola, senza essere sottoposta ad alcuna cura specifica.In alcuni casi i sintomi possono durare anche una settimana. Ma per alcuni l'infezione da STEC può essere molto grave, come nei bambini, che rischiano un ricovero ospedaliero. Tra i sintomi più gravi: pallore, sonnolenza, disfunzione urinaria, edemi diffusi, ittero, convulsioni e sintomi neurologici.

423320437,"But what if you haven’t turned 40 yet? It’s still important to have regular health checks if you’re under 40, as early diagnosis can help to manage and even reverse certain medical conditions, reducing your risk of conditions like heart disease in the future. Dr Sunny Jutla, Specialist Digital Clinician at Medichecks , recommends considering the five health checks listed below if you’re in your 20s or 30s. She added: 'It’s important to look after your health no matter your age - health checks aren’t just for those over 40. 'Early detection of many conditions can help to manage illness. And some conditions can even be reversed through lifestyle changes, so don’t wait until it’s too late.' 1. Cholesterol level check. Dr Jutla says: 'Certain lifestyle factors can increase your risk of high cholesterol, for example eating lots of fatty foods and smoking – two habits that are relatively common in young people. Having a family history of high cholesterol also increases your risk. 'According to the NHS, more than two in five people have high cholesterol, which increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. It’s quick and easy to take a cholesterol blood test from home, and once you’ve received your results you’ll be able to start making any to reduce your levels, for example cutting back on alcohol and smoking, and exercising for at least 150 minutes a week.' 2. Screening for skin cancer. Dr Jutla explains: 'Skin cancer is now the most common type of cancer in the UK, with cases continuing to climb. The good news is that most types of skin cancer can be cured, but early diagnosis is key. 'It’s important to regularly check your skin, particularly areas often exposed to the sun. You should look for any areas that have changed colour or texture and look closely for any changes to moles. 'There are plenty of helpful guides to follow when checking your own skin . If you notice any changes, you should visit your doctor as soon as possible. They can take a look and do a biopsy to test for cancer if necessary.' 3. Iron blood test. Dr Jutla said: 'Iron deficiency anaemia is a type of anaemia caused by a lack of iron in the body. It can lead to complications like increased risk of infections if left untreated. 'It’s a very common condition that You can develop anaemia if you don’t eat enough iron rich foods or if you regularly take steroids or NSAIDs , like ibuprofen. It can also be caused by heavy bleeding from illness, injury or heavy periods. 'If you’re experiencing symptoms like tiredness, low energy levels, shortness of breath and pale skin it’s best to take a blood test . If you discover you have an iron deficiency, speak to your doctor who might recommend daily iron tablets. You can also eat more iron rich foods , like red meats or spinach to help increase your iron levels.' 4. Blood Pressure Check. 'High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can increase your risk of a number of medical problems including strokes and heart attacks,' Dr Jutla warns. 'Up to five million people in England alone have undiagnosed blood pressure , which is why it’s even more important to get it checked by a pharmacist or your GP. 'You can buy a blood pressure cuff to measure yours at home. If you discover your blood pressure is high, there are steps you can take to reduce it, like cutting back on alcohol, stopping smoking and exercising more regularly.' 5. Nutrition Blood Test. Dr Jutla says: 'A healthy, balanced diet should provide you with all the vitamins and minerals you need, but it’s not always easy to eat healthily if you’re on a busy schedule or trying to meet a tight budget. There are also certain food preferences that can increase your risk of deficiencies, for example being vegan can increase your chances of developing vitamin B12 or vitamin D deficiencies. 'A nutrition blood test is a quick and easy way to check your levels of key vitamins and minerals. If you do discover any deficiencies, try incorporating more of the vitamin or mineral into your diet. 'For example, to increase your vitamin B12 intake, try eating more tuna, mackerel or fortified cereals, and for Vitamin D, try adding more salmon, egg yolks and cereals into your meal plan. It’s also a good idea to speak to your doctor who might prescribe a supplement.'",9578,turn important regular health check early diagnosis help manage reverse certain medical condition reduce risk condition like heart disease future dr sunny jutla specialist digital clinician medichecks recommend consider health check list add important look health matter age health check early detection condition help manage illness condition reverse lifestyle change wait late cholesterol level check dr jutla say certain lifestyle factor increase risk high cholesterol example eat lot fatty food smoking habit relatively common young people have family history high cholesterol increase risk accord nhs people high cholesterol increase risk heart disease stroke quick easy cholesterol blood test home receive result able start make reduce level example cut alcohol smoking exercise minute week screen skin cancer dr jutla explain skin cancer common type cancer uk case continue climb good news type skin cancer cure early diagnosis key important regularly check skin particularly area expose sun look area change colour texture look closely change mole plenty helpful guide follow check skin notice change visit doctor soon possible look biopsy test cancer necessary iron blood test dr jutla say iron deficiency anaemia type anaemia cause lack iron body lead complication like increase risk infection leave untreated common condition develop anaemia eat iron rich food regularly steroid nsaid like ibuprofen cause heavy bleeding illness injury heavy period experience symptom like tiredness low energy level shortness breath pale skin good blood test discover iron deficiency speak doctor recommend daily iron tablet eat iron rich food like red meat spinach help increase iron level blood pressure check high blood pressure know hypertension increase risk number medical problem include stroke heart attack dr jutla warn million people england undiagnose blood pressure important check pharmacist gp buy blood pressure cuff measure home discover blood pressure high step reduce like cut alcohol stop smoking exercise regularly nutrition blood test dr jutla say healthy balanced diet provide vitamin mineral need easy eat healthily busy schedule try meet tight budget certain food preference increase risk deficiency example vegan increase chance develop vitamin vitamin d deficiency nutrition blood test quick easy way check level key vitamin mineral discover deficiency try incorporate vitamin mineral diet example increase vitamin intake try eat tuna mackerel fortified cereal vitamin d try add salmon egg yolk cereal meal plan good idea speak doctor prescribe supplement
423320124,"Las tendencias capilares de este otoñó arrastran cortes y coloraciones que han arrasado a lo largo de 2023 y que parece que seguirán convirtiéndose en los favoritos de las mujeres con más estilo. Uno de los cortes que más triunfa en los salones de belleza de España es el que se conoce como 'clavicut' y que ya han llevado 'celebrities' como Ana de Armas, Macarena García o, ahora, Sara Carbonero , que ha sido la última en pasarse a este nuevo look.  El nuevo corte de pelo de Sara Carbonero. La periodista es muy activa en redes sociales. Especialmente en Instagram, Sara Carbonero comparte con frecuencia diferentes fotografías de sus looks o planes y, sin duda, el último post que ha publicado ha conseguido incendiar Instagram porque ha decidido dejar atrás su melena larga y pasarse al corte de pelo más favorecedor: el 'clavicut'. ¿En qué consiste este corte de pelo? Se trata de un peinado a medias entre el bob y en long bob que reina en las peluquerías. Tal y como indica su nombre, este corte es a la altura de la clavícula y ya triunfó en el verano 2022, pero ha sido a lo largo de 2023 cuando se ha confirmado como tendencia absoluta.  ¿Por qué el 'clavicut' es uno de los más pedidos en salones de belleza? 'Es tendencia, favorece a todo tipo de rostros, estiliza, rejuvenece y te hace parecer más alta', explican los expertos de Llongueras. Sin duda, se trata del corte de pelo que tomará el relevo al bob, que tanto ha destacado en los últimos años, porque cuenta con muchas ventajas clave avaladas por los especialistas:  ¿Cómo conseguir volumen con un corte por debajo de la clavícula? Hay muchos tipos de cortes que aportan volumen, pero será imprescindible dar textura al cabello. En este sentido, Alberto Sanguino, experto de Llongueras, explica que 'una técnica que tenemos en el salón es una partición en forma de zigzag o estrella en la zona alta . Esa partición se corta siempre más corta para generar volumen. Esto es algo que le puedes dar a cualquier medida, ya sea por debajo o por encima de la mandíbula'.  Es un corte muy versátil que se adapta a cada tipo de cabello, ya sea pelo fino, rizado, con volumen o sin él. Sanguino afirma 'si tienes mucho pelo, esa estrella la haces más ancha, más grande y difuminas más las capas. Si tienes poquito pelo o un poco fino, la tienes que hacer más estrecha pero también te funciona muy bien'. En el caso del pelo fino, como le ocurre a Sara Carbonero, los expertos aseguran que es clave asegurarse de cortar el cabello a la altura de la clavícula para poder darle densidad . Si el corte está destinado a pelos rizados, el zigzag del que hablan debe ser más pronunciado. ¿Qué mantenimiento requiere este corte? Los estilistas coinciden en que cada mes y medio o dos meses se debe acudir al salón para retocar el largo y el volumen perdido. No obstante, se debe tener en cuenta el tipo de cabello. . ¿Quieres recibir gratis todos los jueves en tu correo los mejores contenidos de belleza, moda y estilo de vida?",9578,las tendencia capilare de este otoñó arrastran corte y coloracione que han arrasado lo largo de y que parece que seguirán convirtiéndose en los favoritos de las mujere con más estilo uno de los corte que más triunfa en los salones de belleza de españa es el que se conoce como clavicut y que ya han llevado celebrity como ana de armas macarena garcía o ahora sara carbonero que ha sido la última en pasarse este nuevo look el nuevo corte de pelo de sara carbonero la periodista es muy activa en rede sociale especialmente en instagram sara carbonero comparte con frecuencia diferente fotografías de sus look o plane y sin duda el último post que ha publicado ha conseguido incendiar instagram porque ha decidido dejar atrás su melena larga y pasarse al corte de pelo más favorecedor el clavicut en qué consiste este corte de pelo se trata de un peinado medias entre el bob y en long bob que reina en las peluquerías tal y como indica su nombre este corte es la altura de la clavícula y ya triunfó en el verano pero ha sido lo largo de cuando se ha confirmado como tendencia absoluta por qué el clavicut es uno de los más pedido en salone de belleza es tendencia favorece todo tipo de rostros estiliza rejuvenece y te hace parecer más alta explican los expertos de llongueras sin duda se trata del corte de pelo que tomará el relevo al bob que tanto ha destacado en los últimos años porque cuenta con muchas ventajas clave avaladas por los especialistas cómo conseguir voluman con un corte por debajo de la clavícula hay muchos tipos de cortes que aportan voluman pero será imprescindible dar textura al cabello en este sentido alberto sanguino experto de llongueras explica que una técnica que tenemos en el salón es una partición en forma de zigzag o estrella en la zona alta esa partición se corta siempre más corta para generar voluman esto es algo que le puede dar cualquier medida ya sea por debajo o por encima de la mandíbula es un corte muy versátil que se adapta cada tipo de cabello ya sea pelo fino rizado con voluman o sin él sanguino afirma si tiene mucho pelo esa estrella la hace más ancha más grande y difuminas más las capas si tiene poquito pelo o un poco fino la tiene que hacer más estrecha pero también te funciona muy bien en el caso del pelo fino como le ocurre sara carbonero los expertos aseguran que es clave asegurarse de cortar el cabello la altura de la clavícula para poder darle densidad si el corte está destinado pelos rizado el zigzag del que hablan debe ser más pronunciado qué mantenimiento requiere este corte los estilistas coinciden en que cada mes y medio o do mese se debe acudir al salón para retocar el largo y el volumen perdido obstante se debe tener en cuenta el tipo de cabello quieres recibir gratis todo los jueve en tu correo los mejores contenido de belleza moda y estilo de vida

423320659,"Bernie Burke, 61, was two months away from walking the Giant’s Causeway Macmillan Mighty Hike to mark the first anniversary of her brother Anthony Larkin’s death from lung cancer when she suffered the subarachnoid haemorrhage in April. After going to hospital with a piercing headache and nausea, Mrs Burke was rushed to Salford Royal and, when an emergency operation to reach the artery through her groin failed, was told she needed immediate brain surgery. The operation was carried out by neurosurgeon Helen Raffalli-Ebezant, who came in on her day off to carry out the procedure to insert a clamp across the artery in Mrs Burke’s brain. Mrs Burke, a finance specialist from Standish, Wigan, spent three weeks in intensive care after the operation, but was determined to recover in time for the hike to raise funds in memory of her brother, who was 57 when he died. She said: 'I told her and all the doctors and nurses I had to get through it because I had the Mighty Hike to do for Ant in Northern Ireland at the end of June. They listened but they kept telling me what a major operation I’d had and how recovery would be very slow and very hard.' She completed the 26-mile walk with son Sean, 34, and handed her medal to Ms Raffalli-Ebezant afterwards. Ms Burke said: 'I was so incredibly lucky. I call myself the ‘walking miracle’. Helen’s skill and her professionalism and kindness saved my life without a doubt. 'I do owe her everything and it was my absolute privilege to give her my Macmillan Mighty Hike medal.' 'I’m indebted to her for life. I’ll never ever forget what Helen did for me. It’s a privilege to still be here. I’m blessed to be here.' Ms Raffalli-Ebezant said she was 'overwhelmed' to receive the medal from her patient. She said: 'It’s a very difficult thing to recover from a subarachnoid haemorrhage. You’re very tired. You’re very achy, so to be able to go out there and walk that whole marathon is such an achievement. And it’s Bernie’s achievement. 'I just came in and did my job. It was Bernie who took her recovery in her own hands and really ran with it and it was very inspirational for me to see that Bernie had been able to do that. 'I have the Mighty Hike medal on my desk. It inspires me – and our trainees who see it and I tell them about Bernie. 'It shows us that our work, while sometimes ending in sadness, can result in the most positive of outcomes for our patients.' Ms Burke’s son Sean, who completed the walk with her, said: 'Crossing the marathon finish line in Belfast arm-in-arm with my mum was a special moment.

423316616,"On Feb. 15, 1989, while I was walking to my gig at Laughs Unlimited Comedy Club in Old Sacramento, the victim of an armed robbery positively identified me as her assailant. I was arrested for seven armed robberies, and it took the police 29 hours to figure out they had the wrong guy. While in hard lockup I learned how to con people, I made criminal connections, and I was assimilated into a gang–pretty much everything you need to make it in show business. This is how it happened. The Haircut. I wanted a new look for the stage, an edgy look. The beautician cut it short with spikes and dyed it black. She added mascara and eyeliner, and I had the crazed look I wanted. She said, 'You look dangerous.' It’s my first night out with my new haircut. I’m in the basement restroom of Dos Padres Restaurant in Old Sacramento, two blocks from Laughs Unlimited. It’s 35 minutes until I go onstage and I’m getting up for my set. I put on mascara and eyeliner and throw punch lines into the mirror. I see a Planned Parenthood sticker on the condom machine and say, 'I believe in Planned Parenthood. There is a right time and a wrong time to have parents.' I dance on my toes, warming up like a prizefighter. 'I am The Reframe Wizard. You can say, ‘California public education is 49th in the nation,’ or you can say, ‘Thank God for Alabama!’ ' Jab, jab, uppercut.  'How did I get so successful? I was a salesman going door to door selling No Soliciting signs.' Boom! I head for the stairs but there is congestion, I can’t get around three big cowboys. They grab my arms and yell, 'Don’t freak out! Don’t freak out!' Who grabs a total stranger and yells, 'Don’t freak out'?! I flap my arms up and down, giving all three a ride. It seems that three drunken cowboys are forcing me to square dance. Or maybe I’m in the hands of an organ harvesting cartel and am going to wake up with no kidneys. I try to remember if I had signed my organ donor card. I yell, 'Police!' They go, 'Yes!' I yell louder, 'Police!' They go, 'Yes!' And I go, 'Police?' 'Yes. We’re undercover.' Oh, thank God they’re cops. I am so relieved. I figure it’s time to straighten this out, 'Hey fellas, what’s up? I’ve got a show to do, I’m on in 30 minutes.' They handcuff my hands behind my back. They walk me outside and stand me against a brick wall. I’m being kept from getting to my gig and it gets harder to breathe. It keeps getting darker, it keeps getting later. That’s Him. I apparently look guilty to everyone with my hands handcuffed behind my back. Everyone passing by stops to take a long, hard look at what the bad guy looks like. (He’s got to be guilty. Why else would the police have him?) I have never seen people look at me with such revulsion and disgust, and I’ve played some rough rooms. I don’t quite get what is happening yet, but this is bumming me out, I need to be in an elevated mood to perform standup at Laughs Unlimited Comedy Club. The cops bring forward a well-dressed young lady who stops 20 feet from me. She has mascara running down her face, my guess from crying. Her hair hangs in tangles, she is breathing hard, and she looks at the ground like she is afraid to look at me. My arresting officer tries to get her to move towards me, but she refuses to come closer. He asks her to look up, and she follows his arm and pointing finger to look at me for three seconds. I see her grimace, purse her lips and nod. 'That’s him.' Then she turns away and never looks at me again. I want to ask her, 'Excuse me miss, what exactly do you mean, ‘That’s him’?' I do not know at this point what I am being charged with. In a perverted twist of double-blind eyewitness theory, all parties, both the police and the eyewitness, know I am the suspect, both know what the crime is. The only 'blind' participant is me. As 'Sarge' reads me my rights, he tells me it is for armed robbery. I urge him to walk two blocks to the comedy club where I have worked all week. His youngest deputy says, 'Sarge, you sure we got the right guy? He’s got all these comedy club paycheck stubs in his wallet.' Sarge looks at the night sky, takes a deep breath and says, 'I got a positive ID.' He spins me around and hisses, 'Gotcha!' I’m pushed into the back seat of a police car by a hand on the back of my head. I’m not going to my gig, and I feel my spirit leave my body. The car floats through the streets of Sacramento, past buildings I have been in but now are strange, cold, distant. We turn into the rear of the police compound on 7th and H. Two cops walk me across the parking lot towards the buildings, stripping me as we walk. They take my wallet, they take my belt, everything out of my pockets, and look them over as we walk. From the moment Sarge had said, 'Gotcha!', their attitude towards me changed from fear and suspicion to contempt. Police you meet in public are trained to be nice, in jail they treat you like the scum of the earth. You’re In The Jailhouse Now. They take all my possessions except for my contact lens case and put me in a holding cell packed with 30 men who are in for everything from peeing in public to murder. I’m wearing a silk white jacket, a skinny black tie and makeup. Wearing mascara and eyeliner is not the look you want in jail. Hours pass. The tank is hot with the smell of men, I close my eyes and doze standing up. Two men are talking, they’re here to stand trial for murders they had allegedly committed in Folsom Prison. 'Hey man, I hear they’re having trouble with the pool up at Folsom.' 'What’s wrong with the pool?' 'The water keeps turning red.' Har, har, har. There is no easier way to learn how to con people than to go to jail, and I quickly get the hang of it. A six-foot six-inch skinhead steps in front of me, he has a swastika tattooed on his cheek. He pulls my arrest sheet out of my hands, tantamount to a bitch slap. The cell falls silent, they all want to know what the weirdo is in for. The skinhead moves his lips. I’m amazed he can read. 'Armed robbery. You?' There are murmurs of approval. He frowns. 'It says seven counts of armed robbery. You? You committed armed robbery seven times?' I shrug. 'Who keeps count?' Gasps of admiration. Everyone is smiling and nodding their head at me. I’m thinking, 'I could make it big here.' My eyes are burning, I know I’ve got to take my hard contacts off and put them in my carrying case, but I do not want anyone to know of my vision weakness. A place opens against the wall, I sit down and lean back. It takes me 30 minutes to take off my contacts by covering my lens case and removing my lenses with movements that look like I have an itch on the bridge of my nose. I get them into my lens case undetected. They call 20 of our names and we file into a second waiting room where we are given a quarter and get to use a pay phone. I call my brother and explain that he’ll need to purchase a bail bond for $50,000. I hear the big guy from Folsom Prison counseling a young man to not follow a life of crime, but to get out, go home and take care of his family. The younger man says, 'But I go crazy when the baby starts crying at night.' 'Well, when the baby cries you get up and get it a bottle. You take care of that baby and do not follow me here. It doesn’t get better here.' I am fascinated by this jailhouse shaman, this wise convict counselor, and want to get a look at him. He senses me looking at him and spins around, his red eyes bore into mine. His glare says, 'Fuck with me and I will kill you.' I get the message loud and clear and we never make eye contact again. They lead us into a big wire cage for strip search. We stand in a circle facing the center and we’re ordered to strip. I try to get into a Gandhi state of mind, but I am so mad and so afraid that my veins stick out and my muscles twitch. Is it a good thing or a bad thing that I look like a homicidal maniac? We strip and are told to put our hands over our cocks while cops with billy clubs stand behind us. One at a time we bend over to grab our ankles while a cop gets down on one knee to look up our ass. The kneeling cop tells us to cough three times. I think, 'At last, I’m receiving the very best of Republican health care.' I remember a joke about an inmate who had saved a fart for this moment, but I doubt it would get a big enough laugh to warrant broken bones. We are given uniforms; they’re like blue flannel PJs with white stripes, along with cloth booties and a towel. They take us to our cells and tell us which bunk is ours. This is a relief–the way to make time pass in jail is to sleep. Saved By An Angel. I lay in my bunk and think of the guy out there who did the robberies. What if I’m a dead ringer for him? What if seven people take the stand, point at me, and say I robbed them at gunpoint? There is no solace in being judged by 12 of my peers. My peers are dumb as fuck. I’m going to convince a lifetime Walmart cashier and a guy who hands out shoes in a bowling alley that seven people who are sure I robbed them have it all wrong? I fall asleep in my bunk, but even in sleep I still hear the sounds of the jail; steel doors slamming, voices shouting, canned laughter from a TV. It takes the police twenty-nine hours to figure out that they got the wrong guy. I am saved by my investigating officer, Detective Allan Aires, an African-American man who takes the time to look into my innocence. As he grills me about my whereabouts for the day, I tell him that they have the wrong guy. 'That’s it? You’re just saying that you’re not the guy?' 'Yes sir.' 'How many times have you been arrested?' 'I’ve never been arrested in my life.' 'What? You’ve never been arrested?' 'No sir. Never.' Detective Aires spins away, runs his hands through his hair, trying to square my lack of a record with the charges of seven armed robberies. He shakes his head. 'OK. I’ll check out your story, but if you’re lying to me, I will fuck you up.' Detective Aires saved me. He goes away for 24 and returns to say, 'I believe you.' When the jailhouse cops begrudgingly take me to get my belongings for release, they are incensed that they have to let me go: 'Guess there’s not enough on you to make it stick this time, asshole. We’ll be waiting for you.' In The End It Was Hair and Skin. After I get out on February 17, I contact Detective Aires and he agrees to try to expunge my record. I meet him down at the jail and we talk about my case. He is deeply concerned about how I’m taking my experience with his department. He laughs, 'You’re not going to be too hard on us from the stage are you?' Then he shows me a picture of the man they finally arrested for the holdups. 'Richard, you can see the resemblance.' It’s a Polaroid of a skinny Italian man with spiky hair. The only resemblance is our hair and the color of our skin. Tell It To The Judge I’ve been seething about my bust for 34 years and that’s why I was so excited to read about the new California statute, Senate Bill 923, that gives police and prosecutors guidelines to make eyewitness testimony more reliable. I asked retired Santa Cruz Superior Court Judge John Salazar how this new statute will help. Judge Salazar said, 'If a police officer arrests somebody, and they have a good sense that this is the right person, consciously or subconsciously there could be some bias in that procedure, unless it’s blind. If there is unconscious body language, nodding your head, tensing up, gesturing, leaning, you don’t want to take that identification, because once the victim identifies someone, typically they stick with it. In their mind they build up their assurances that this is the right person.' I said, 'But in my case, they did it right there, handcuffed. I looked guilty as hell.' 'That is why the new law is there, to minimize suggestiveness. The way the officers did it with you would not be allowed now, under this law, which wouldn’t eliminate it, but help prevent misidentification. Police can do things, like not handcuff you. That is one of those things lawmen typically won’t do anymore. It clearly means you’re a suspect. But just standing there, whole different thing. We want people to look like they normally do. With bias, where is your impartiality? Where is your ‘innocent until proven guilty’? You lose that.' What I Hope. Last week I told my jail tale to Santa Cruz defense attorney Zach Schwarzbach, and he said, 'You are very lucky. That detective did not have to help you, many wouldn’t.' I often think about what Detective Aires did for me and I hope I can find him through social media. I want to thank him for these past 34 years of freedom that let me raise my children. I hope we can help police, prosecutors and juries make 'innocent until proven guilty' a reality. I hope that the good citizens serving on juries study the science of eyewitness reliability to keep innocent people out of prison. And for the 2,305,258 Americans who are currently locked up, I hope we can exonerate those who are in there for walking to work with the wrong haircut.

423317038,"Was hieß das konkret? Wir lebten in einer kleinen Sozialbau-Wohnung in Krefeld. Entbehrung habe ich als Kind zunächst nicht wegen Geldmangel empfunden, sondern weil meine Eltern geschieden waren. Meine Mutter hätte mich nicht aufziehen können, sie kam mich in unregelmäßigen Abständen besuchen. Und Ihre Großeltern? Sie haben sich streng, aber fürsorglich um mich gekümmert. Meine Oma starb leider früh, 1979. Da war ich 16. Mein Großvater sechs Jahre später. Von den rund 1500 D-Mark, die wir drei damals monatlich zur Verfügung hatten, knappsten sie auch noch das Geld für einen kleinen Urlaub pro Jahr ab. Die mehrstündigen Wanderungen in Sandalen fand ich als Kind sehr unspannend. Wann haben Sie angefangen, soziale Unterschiede wahrzunehmen? Meine Grundschule stand in unserem Viertel. Da waren solche Differenzen noch nicht spürbar und ich sozusagen „in guter Gesellschaft'. Alle hatten gleich wenig. Die Wahrnehmung änderte sich mit dem Wechsel aufs altsprachliche Gymnasium. Wer kam auf die Idee, Sie da hinzuschicken? Meine Grundschullehrerin. Man trifft im Leben oft Menschen – außerhalb der Familie –, die einem helfen, Anstöße geben und die wahnsinnig wichtig, aber eben auch Glückssache sind. Meine Großeltern machten nur klar: Ich darf nicht sitzenbleiben. Sonst wäre Schluss mit dem Gymnasium, und eine Lehre stünde an. Wie wichtig die Schulentscheidung für den ganzen Lebensweg ist, war mir damals natürlich nicht klar. Plötzlich saßen Sie zwischen den Kindern von Ärzten, Unternehmern und Juristen? Genau, jedenfalls ganz überwiegend. Damals war unser Gymnasium noch etwas für die „besseren Kreise'. Ich erinnere mich an einen Mitschüler, der mich mal zu Hause besuchte und sagte: „In der Bruchbude wohnt ihr also.' Das schmerzte. Sagen wir es so: Es war mir unangenehm. Ich sah ja auch die schönen Einfamilienhäuser oder Wohnungen der anderen. Dass meine Eltern geschieden waren, habe ich allerdings lange als den größeren Makel erlebt – auch sozial. Dass es woanders auch krachte, wurde ja meist gut vertuscht. Was verriet am Gymnasium Ihren eigenen Status? Natürlich auch die Kleidung und Ausstattung. Ich denke, das ist bis heute so, auch wenn’s nun eher um das Smartphone-Modell geht. Die Marken der anderen konnte ich mir lange schlicht nicht leisten. Erst mit 16 klappte das dann zum Beispiel mit den Cowboystiefeln, die zu der Zeit den Coolness-Faktor ausmachten. Wie haben Sie die bezahlt? Ich habe halt nebenbei gearbeitet und war sparsam. Schon ab der Grundschule half ich meinem Opa, Pakete mit Drucksachen auszuliefern, was damals noch eher spielerisch war. Später habe ich außerdem Prospekte ausgetragen und einen Job in einem Großhandelslager angenommen. Würden Sie sagen, Ihre Großeltern waren „bildungsfern', wie das heute heißt? Als Buchdrucker kannte sich mein Opa mit der deutschen Sprache gut aus. Ansonsten wurde zu Hause plattdeutsch gesprochen. Ich habe viel gelesen – vor allem Bücher über Abenteuer, Politik und Nachkriegsgeschichte. Es gab aber bei uns zu Hause nicht den Plan: Der René muss jetzt ein Instrument lernen und ein halbes Jahr ins Ausland. Dafür war wirklich kein Geld da. Wurde die finanzielle Situation Ihrer Kleinfamilie am Abendbrottisch diskutiert? Jeden Tag. Das war wirklich ein Dauerthema. Mein Opa hatte eine kleine Druckerei, die nie viel einbrachte, seit ich denken konnte. Er schaffte es einfach nicht, mit den technischen Entwicklungen Schritt zu halten, musste aber bis kurz vor seinem Tod arbeiten, weil er als Selbstständiger keine Rücklagen mehr hatte und keine Rente bekam. Seine Sorgen waren tatsächlich existenziell. Auch nachts sah ich ihn oft, wie er sich Notizen machte oder irgendwas kalkulierte. Wenn Sie schon als Kind diesen dauernden Druck erleben, macht das was mit Ihnen. Was war’s in Ihrem Fall? Es wurde mir zum Ansporn. Der Mangel hat mich motiviert. Ich wollte da raus. Unbedingt. In der Schulzeit fühlt man sich ja politisch oft eher links zu Hause. Was war Ihr Weg? Ich war zunächst hin und her gerissen. Meine Mutter lebte damals in einem eher linken Künstler-Milieu. Die Thesen dort fand ich zumindest teilweise einleuchtend. Ich sah aber auch, dass man in der „Helmut-Kohl-Welt', in der sich Leistung ja lohnen sollte, mehr erreichen kann. Nach dem Abitur wurde mir klar, dass ich eher der Typ für Marktwirtschaft und Freiheit bin. Ich wollte „etwas werden' und Geld verdienen. So einfach war das. Wie fiel Ihr Abi-Schnitt aus? Sehr mittelmäßig. Die Noten waren auf unserer Schule im Schnitt aber auch nicht gerade inflationär gut. Schwache Erklärung, ich weiß. Aber ich war sehr froh, es geschafft zu haben. Ihre Zeit nach dem Abitur verlief trotzdem untypisch, oder? Ich ging zur Bundeswehr und wollte mich verpflichten, weil ich dort schneller hätte Medizin studieren können. Das war mein erster Traum. Ich war aber mit einem Offizier befreundet, der mir dringend davon abriet. Nach der Bundeswehrzeit machte ich ein Praktikum bei einer kleinen IT-Firma in Frankfurt und danach eine gute Ausbildung bei BMW zum Industriekaufmann, mit Auslandseinsatz und tollen Bildungsmöglichkeiten. Denen bin ich bis heute dankbar, aber einen Fehler haben sie doch gemacht. Inwiefern? Sie haben uns nicht das Gefühl gegeben, dass wir alles schaffen können, wenn wir hart daran arbeiten. Wissen Sie: Wir standen damals vor der BMW -Zentrale in München, diesem Gebäude, das aussieht wie ein Vierzylinder. Und ich sagte, dass ich eines Tages in der Vorstandsetage mein Büro haben will. Und dann hieß es, dafür müsste ich weiter studieren, promovieren, vernetzt sein und und und … Es wurde in den Achtzigern viel darüber diskutiert, wie verantwortlich die Gesellschaft ist, wenn Leute aus armen Verhältnissen den Aufstieg nicht schaffen. Ist da was dran? Sicher, Chancengerechtigkeit war damals Illusion und ist bis heute nicht wirklich Realität. Aber das Lamentieren darüber löst das Problem nicht. Lou Reed singt in „Men of Good Fortune', dass reich geboren kein Garant für Erfolg ist. Eigene Motivation kann zumindest ein sehr kraftvoller Antrieb sein. Ich kenne Leute, die aus sehr guten Elternhäusern kommen, alle Wege geöffnet bekamen und erfolgreich wurden – und andere scheiterten mit den gleichen Voraussetzungen. Und aus den ärmeren Schichten gibt’s Leute wie mich, die Glück haben. Sie haben die besseren Startchancen der anderen nie als ungerecht empfunden? Oh doch! Klar. Und für Kinder aus gleichermaßen sozial schwachen wie bildungsfernen Familien sind die Chancen wirklich nicht vergleichbar. Das ist und bleibt eine Schande. Stand Ihnen ganz oben als Telekom -Chef eigentlich mal Ihre Herkunft im Weg? Ich musste natürlich aufpassen, selber keine Vorurteile zu entwickeln gegenüber Kolleginnen und Kollegen aus „guten' Häusern. Solche verspäteten Neidgefühle wären genauso unfair wie Misstrauen gegenüber jemanden aus armen Verhältnissen. Es dürfen nur Integrität, Kompetenz und Leistung zählen. Gerade einem Konzern wie der Telekom hilft es, eine auch sozial divers geprägte Belegschaft zu haben. Das Unternehmen bedient mit seinen Produkten ja auch alle Schichten. Hat die soziale Durchlässigkeit in Deutschland nachgelassen? Sie hat zumindest nicht ausreichend zugenommen. Einerseits erreichen heute rund 40 Prozent der Jugendlichen die Allgemeine Hochschulreife. Andererseits ist Schule nicht gleich Schule. Die Finanzelite schickt ihre Kids auf Eliteschulen. Und es gibt einen unverändert hohen Anteil, der durch jeden schulischen Rost fällt. Das dürfen wir nicht zulassen. Es ist gesellschaftlich maximal unfair und angesichts des demografischen Wandels und des wachsenden Fachkräftemangels einfach dumm. Die Unternehmerin Anna Maria Braun wies im Interview mit uns darauf hin, dass ihr Konzern selbst aktiv wird mit Förderprogrammen, weil 2,5 Millionen junge Menschen keine abgeschlossene Ausbildung haben … … was ein echter Skandal ist. Frau Braun erzählte auch, wie aufwendig es werden kann, wenn eine Eins-zu-eins-Begleitung eines Jugendlichen nötig wird … … die wir uns als Land sparen könnten, wenn wir uns eine bessere Unterstützung von der Kita bis zur Oberschule leisten würden. Ebenso eine ganztägige und flächendeckende pädagogisch geschulte Betreuung, nicht nur, aber auch für die Vielzahl der Flüchtlingskinder. Wer zahlt das? Eltern, die das Geld haben, sollen es selbst bezahlen. Die anderen müssten dafür mehr staatliche Unterstützung bekommen. Dafür würde ich als Gutverdiener gern einen Bildungssoli bezahlen. Wir dürfen nicht zulassen, dass eine große Zahl von Kindern in unserem Land quasi unerkannt in die geistige Verwahrlosung rutscht. Ich habe schon vor Jahren gesagt, dass wir einen Pakt brauchen zwischen Politik, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Passiert ist leider nichts. Hat das nicht auch mit der Kurzatmigkeit der Politik zu tun, die nur bis zu den nächsten Wahlen denkt? Mag sein. Ich glaube aber, dass viele Bundesbürger Verständnis zeigen würden, wenn man ihnen das Projekt gut erklärt. Bildung wird doch immer als eines der wichtigsten Themen genannt. Wir müssen jetzt anfangen, um in 20 Jahren die Früchte zu ernten. Grünen-Familienministerin Lisa Paus hat jüngst eine Kindergrundsicherung erkämpft. FDP -Finanzminister Christian Lindner warnt vor Fehlsteuerungen. Wo stehen Sie da? Es löst sicher nicht allein die Probleme, pauschal den Eltern in sozialschwachen Verhältnissen mehr Geld zu geben. Wir brauchen jetzt viel Geld und Kompetenz, um die Zahl der Erzieher und Lehrerinnen, deren pädagogische Möglichkeiten, die schulische Infrastruktur und Ausstattung zu verbessern, und zwar schnellstens. Es müssen auch nicht alle studieren. Unsere Fachkräfte der Zukunft können wir mit der dualen Ausbildung sehr gut entwickeln, von Handwerk oder Industrie über medizinische Berufe bis zur IT. Wer schafft es am Ende nach oben? Jene, die frühzeitig verstehen, dass sie sich insgesamt gut und auch technologisch ausbilden müssen. Weitsichtige und finanziell gut ausgestattete Elternhäuser können helfen. Aber das und gute Schule allein reichen nicht. Es kommt auf dich selbst an: Was willst du, wovon träumst du? Machen wir uns nichts vor: Aufstieg ist anstrengend, kostet viel Kraft und Zeit. Was hieß das in Ihrem Fall? Dass ich als Unternehmer und Manager 70 bis 80 Stunden pro Woche arbeiten musste. Bis heute hat sich das nicht grundlegend geändert. Als Gründer kannte ich kein Wochenende oder längere Urlaube. Meine Arbeit war und ist nach wie vor faszinierend. Aber man muss das wollen. Wie erleben Sie die hiesigen Debatten um Work-Life-Balance oder Vier-Tage-Woche? Was eine gute Work-Life-Balance ist, muss jeder für sich selbst herausfinden. Egal in welchem Job – wer etwas Großes gestalten will, muss Zeit investieren, sich sehr anstrengen und dauernd hinzulernen. Egal ob als Künstler, Handwerkerin, Manager, Unternehmerin oder Beamte. Klingt wie: Von nix kommt nix. Was ich nicht gut finde, ist der Anspruch, für immer weniger Arbeit die gleiche Bezahlung zu bekommen. Wenn Unternehmen heute alle möglichen Arten von Arbeitszeitmodellen anbieten, ist das super und hilft im Kampf um die besten Talente, der längst weltweit stattfindet. Aber was wir gesamtgesellschaftlich nicht erwarten können, ist eine Wirtschaft, die letztlich die Freizeit alimentiert. Umverteilung allein schafft nicht Wohlstand und Gerechtigkeit. Ich bin dagegen, den Leistungsgedanken abzuschaffen – in der Schule wie auch im Beruf. Ihre eigenen Töchter wuchsen in Wohlstand auf. Wie haben Sie denen die nötige Sensibilität bewahrt? Musste ich nicht. Die sind sehr geerdet, frei von Dünkel und in einer diversen Community großgeworden, erst in Münster, später in Bonn. Klar ging es uns wirtschaftlich sehr gut. Aber unsere Familien sind ganz normale Leute. Meine Töchter verfolgen ihre beruflichen Träume sehr engagiert. Heute als Finanzinvestor haben Sie mit einer extrem homogenen Truppe gleich gesinnter Topkräfte zu tun, oder? Diese Homogenität besteht allenfalls in der Top-Ausbildung. Und in der Hinsicht, dass alle kluge, junge Leute sind und etwas erreichen wollen. Wir haben das riesige Privileg, dass sich so gut ausgebildete Leute für uns entscheiden … sagt der Mann, der einst sein Studium der Volkswirtschaft abbrach. Ich habe gleich am Anfang des Studiums in Münster eine Telekommunikations-Firma gegründet, die schnell größer wurde. Da musste ich mich entscheiden. Was erinnert Sie heute noch an Ihre Wurzeln in der „Unteren Mittelschicht' Ihrer Oma? Ich mag keine Verschwendung, lasse tatsächlich das Wasser nicht unnötig laufen und schalte das Licht aus, wenn ich einen Raum verlasse. Vor allem: Ich kann kein Essen wegschmeißen und bin erst dann fertig, wenn mein Teller leer ist. Schräg, oder?",9578,hieß das konkret wir lebten einer kleinen sozialbau wohnung krefeld entbehrung habe ich al kind zunächst nicht wegen geldmangel empfunden sondern weil meine eltern geschieden waren

423314963,"ZINDA JAN DISTRICT, Afghanistan — Wails echoed across what was left of the village when the ambulance arrived. Inside was the body of a 12-year-old girl, Roqia. She had died in a nearby hospital Tuesday morning, four days after a devastating earthquake hit this stretch of northwestern Afghanistan and sent her mud-brick home crashing down on top of her. The vehicle drove to the top of a nearby hill where mounds of dirt marked around 70 freshly dug graves. A crowd of men gathered and opened its back door, gently pulling out the girl, whose small frame was wrapped in a thick, white blanket. Seeing her, her uncle, Shir Ahmad, stumbled backward. “Oh God, oh God,” he cried, gasping for breath. A man slipped his arms around his back to steady him as he sank to the ground in sobs. “I lost four relatives,” the man said. “Don’t cry.” Four days since the deadliest earthquake to strike Afghanistan in decades, hundreds of Afghans in one of the worst-hit districts, Zinda Jan, are struggling to come to terms with the almost unfathomable destruction. In a matter of minutes, a handful of entire villages — once clusters of mud-brick homes, their thick, beige walls blending into the endless desert — transformed into mounds of dust. Nearly everyone in the area lost at least one relative when their homes crumbled. Many have lost most, if not all, of their immediate family. The district is little more than a stretch of desert punctuated by villages where people live hand-to-mouth along Afghanistan’s western border. Most families survive by growing wheat, corn and figs in modest gardens, and shepherding small livestock herds. Many men work as day laborers in neighboring Iran, earning only a few hundred dollars a month. By Tuesday, the death toll from the quakes had climbed to at least 1,053 people, according to the United Nations, while Taliban officials have said the true figure could be closer to 2,000. The vast majority of those dead belonged to only 11 villages, some of which lost a quarter or more of their populations in the quake. Early Wednesday, another 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit near Herat City, sending people running out of their homes for the second time in five days. Across the hamlets struck by the earlier quakes, the grief and loss are palpable. The air is tinged with the smell of rotting flesh — whether from victims whose bodies have yet to be recovered or from livestock that were crushed under rubble, no one is quite sure. Rows upon rows of dirt mounds marking mass graves now outline the edges of villages that have been decimated. Sporadic screams and sobs pierce the quiet as waves of anguish overwhelm the few survivors. In Seya Aab village, moments after the men lowered Roqia’s body into a grave Tuesday afternoon, a young man whose mother had also been killed collapsed on top of her grave in tears. “Oh God, oh God, please help me,” he yelled. Farther down the hill, now a newly dug cemetery, a grandfather let out a cry and dropped to his knees, drawing a crowd around him. Minutes later, another man howled in tears and screamed: “They are all of us! They are all of us!” In Nayeb Rafi, a nearby village, the only building to survive the quake was a concrete school built by an aid group. Every single mud-brick home was destroyed. Residents told a visiting team of journalists from The New York Times that they estimate that of the roughly 2,000 people living there, 750 were killed in the quake. At the edge of the hamlet, a man in his 70s sat on the edge of a pile of mud brick — what was once his home — in a daze. He had wrapped a hefty brown blanket dug out from the rubble around his shoulders to protect himself from the chilly morning air. Behind him, black smoke from a small fire another survivor had lit for warmth clouded the sky. The man, who goes by one name, Zarin, said he had just slaughtered a sheep for his family to eat Saturday when the earth beneath him began to shake violently, throwing him to the ground. When the convulsions finally ended, he was up to his chest in crumbled mud brick. He could hear a child’s voice crying for help, but he could barely see anything amid clouds of white dust, he said. When he finally pried himself free from the rubble, he began frantically digging with his hands through the debris where his house once stood. He and another villager pulled out his granddaughter, alive, then turned their attention to where they heard two women’s voices shouting for help. “I could hear them crying: ‘Father! Uncle! Brother! Help me! I’m still alive!’” Zarin recalled. They managed to dig out one woman who was pregnant. She was bloodied and coughing up dust, but alive, he said. By the time they found the other woman, it was too late. “Everything is gone,” he said. Nearby, a teenage boy sat outside a bright blue makeshift tent, decorated with waves and palm trees, that an aid organization had given him the day prior. He had been walking in a nearby pasture with his family’s eight sheep when the quake struck. He abandoned the livestock and ran to his home only to find a pile of dust — and silence. Beneath it, his mother, his father, his younger sister and two brothers had all died. “I don’t even know what happened to the sheep,” the boy, Khan Mohammad, 18, said, staring blankly at the horizon. Hours after the quake hit Saturday, volunteers from nearby Herat city and government workers made their way through the desert dunes and rough roads to the village, helping residents pull their loved ones from the rubble and shuttling injured people to a nearby hospital. But by Tuesday, efforts to rescue people had ended. Instead, volunteer crews armed with shovels and excavators knew their task had become more somber: recovering the remains of those missing, any hope they might still be alive gone. One man, Sirajuddin, 45, worked alongside his brother and uncle with a shovel and pickax to recover what they could — a bag of flour here, a pan there. “Where is Wais?” he asked his uncle, Naeem, 58, who had just returned from visiting injured relatives in the hospital in Herat city that morning. “He was with his daughter; she’s OK,” he replied. “What about Zahra?” Sirajuddin, who goes by one name, asked. Naeem shrugged, the cousin’s fate unknown. Explaining what was once their close-knit community, the men rattled off the names of their neighbors, and the loss each of them just incurred. There was Jan Mohammad, a farmer, whose wife and two daughters died. Next door to him was Nazar, a man in his 60s who died alongside his 5-year-old and 2-year-old grandsons. Further down was Gafar, whose daughter was killed; Sataar, whose brother and two sons were killed; and a widow, Maryam, whose 18-year-old daughter died. And then there was Ahmad’s family of five. Only his daughter and son survived. As Sirajuddin dug, a forest green police vehicle roared through town, an officer calling through its loudspeaker for people to go to the edge of the city to help improve a mass grave site where around 300 people were buried the night before. There, hundreds of men — mostly volunteers from villages across the province — picked up shovels and began tossing dirt on top of six rows of graves. Every 2 or 4 feet, they placed a stone, an imprecise but symbolic way to differentiate each person buried in the ditches. One volunteer, Abdi Mohammadi, 45, paused to look over the gravesite. Then he shook his head. “This place has seen the wrath of God,” he said.

423316722,"'Stava male ma non l’hanno ricoverata. Ora che non c'è più voglio sapere perché è morta' . Sono le parole piene di dolore marito di Pamela Pelle , la trentanovenne scomparsa alcuni giorni dopo aver partorito la sua terza figlia al Policlinico Agostino Gemelli di Roma. Intervistato da La Repubblica, ha spiegato di aver depositato la denuncia ai carabinieri , assistito dal suo avvocato Erdis Doraci.

Vuole vederci chiaro sulla vicenda che riguarda il decesso della madre dei suoi figli, per capire se qualora fosse stata ricoverata per i sintomi che aveva si sarebbe potuta salvare e se ci siano stati ritardi nei soccorsi. Un quadro sul quale adesso dovrà far luce la Procura della Repubblica di Roma. I carabinieri ieri hanno sequestrato la cartella clinica della paziente, le indagini sono in corso.

'Aveva dolori e perdite di sangue' Pamela Pelle era la moglie di Vincenzo Rinaldi appunto, il titolare di Rinaldi al Quirinale, uno dei più importante e famosi ristoranti al centro di Roma. Ha ripercorso i concitati momenti da quando la moglie ha iniziato ad avvertire alcuni sintomi, durante il suo stato di malessere che è continuato, fino a quando ormai dimessa dall'ospedale le sue condizioni di salute a distanza di alcuni giorni dal parto sono peggiorate, fino al decesso. 'Abbiamo soprattutto fatto presenti i dolori che ha accusato e le perdite di sangue, ma ci hanno più volte detto che era normale' ha spiegato, riferendosi appunto a quando sua moglie avrebbe detto ai medici di non stare bene.

'I dati registrati nella cartella clinica non confermano la riferita copiosa perdita di sangue durante il parto' e che 'si ritiene di poter affermare, sulla base degli elementi complessivamente disponibili, che la morte della signora sia avvenuta per cause naturali, non prevenibili né ricorrendo al prolungamento della ospedalizzazione, né ampliando il ventaglio della terapia prescritta a domicilio' Chiesto il sequestro della salma di Pamela Pelle e l'autopsia. Nella denuncia il marito assistito dal suo avvocato ha espresso tutti i passaggi che gli risultano poco chiari, dalle visite dopo gli accessi al pronto soccorso al quale Pamela si era rivolta perché non si sentiva bene, poi rimandata a casa. Fino ad arrivare ad un presunto ritardo dell'ambulanza, a dire del marito, quando l'ha chiamata con la richiesta di raggiungere la loro abitazione con urgenza, prima che Pamela morisse. Il marito ha richiesto il sequestro della salma e l'autopsia , per fare chiarezza sulle cause che hanno provocato il decesso della moglie e per capire se ci siano responsabilità a carico dei sanitari che si sono presi cura di lei.",9578,stava male ma non ricoverata ora che non più voglio sapere perché è morta sono le parole piene di dolore marito di pamela pelle la trentanovenne scomparsa alcuni giorni dopo aver partorito la sua terza figlia al policlinico agostino gemelli di roma intervistato da la repubblica ha spiegato di aver depositato la denuncia ai carabinieri assistito dal suo avvocato erdis doraci vuole vederci chiaro sulla vicenda che riguarda il decesso della madre dei suoi figli capire se qualora fosse stata ricoverata sintomi che aveva si sarebbe potuta salvare e se ci siano stati ritardi nei soccorsi un quadro sul quale adesso dovrà far luce la procura della repubblica di roma carabinieri ieri hanno sequestrato la cartella clinica della paziente le indagini sono corso aveva dolori e perdite di sangue pamela pelle era la moglie di vincenzo rinaldi appunto il titolare di rinaldi al quirinale uno dei più importante e famosi ristoranti al centro di roma ha ripercorso concitati momenti da quando la moglie ha iniziato ad avvertire alcuni sintomi durante il suo stato di malessere che è continuato fino quando ormai dimessa le sue condizioni di salute distanza di alcuni giorni dal parto sono peggiorate fino al decesso abbiamo soprattutto fatto presenti dolori che ha accusato e le perdite di sangue ma ci hanno più volte detto che era normale ha spiegato riferendosi appunto quando sua moglie avrebbe detto ai medici di non stare bene dati registrati nella cartella clinica non confermano la riferita copiosa perdita di sangue durante il parto e che si ritiene di poter affermare sulla base degli elementi complessivamente disponibili che la morte della signora sia avvenuta cause naturali non prevenibili né ricorrendo al prolungamento della ospedalizzazione né ampliando il ventaglio della terapia prescritta domicilio chiesto il sequestro della salma di pamela pelle e nella denuncia il marito assistito dal suo avvocato ha espresso tutti passaggi che gli risultano poco chiari dalle visite dopo gli accessi al pronto soccorso al quale pamela si era rivolta perché non si sentiva bene poi rimandata casa fino ad arrivare ad un presunto ritardo dire del marito quando chiamata con la richiesta di raggiungere la loro abitazione con urgenza prima che pamela morisse il marito ha richiesto il sequestro della salma e fare chiarezza sulle cause che hanno provocato il decesso della moglie e capire se ci siano responsabilità carico dei sanitari che si sono presi cura di lei
423314570,"26 bite-sized videos have been produced to help people with long COVID The Hampshire and Isle of Wight long Covid service hopes the 26 short films will assist with breathing difficulties and fatigue - helping people to better understand and manage symptoms. M ost people with COVID-19 feel better within a few days or weeks of their first symptoms and make a full recovery within 12 weeks. When symptoms last longer than 12 weeks it's considered to be long COVID. The first set of videos are designed to help people understand more about normal breathing and why they may be feeling more breathless. It highlights strategies to help people improve their breathing pattern to reduce symptoms of breathlessness and an irritable cough, as well as guidance on how to return to activity and exercise. Why did Hamas strike now? In the latest quick-briefing episode, from Tel Aviv, ITV News Senior International Correspondent John Irvine tells Julie Etchingham what you need to know. The second set of videos were put together to help people living with fatigue. Topics include the importance of energy management through planning and pacing of daily activities, rest, relaxation and improving sleep quality. Karen West from the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Long COVID service said: 'Although these videos were designed for patients experiencing Long COVID, the self-management techniques described would also be very useful for anyone experiencing symptoms of fatigue, or who have been diagnosed with a breathing pattern disorder such as asthma or COPD.' All videos are on the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board website. Emma Major from the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Long COVID service said: 'When we recorded the videos in March 2023, 1.8 million people in the UK were estimated to have Long COVID, and Long COVID symptoms are adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of 1.5 million people. 'There are more than 200 symptoms associated with Long COVID, which may include respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological and dermatological issues. People also report mental health issues; predominately depression and anxiety. 'Everyone's experience of Long COVID will be different but fatigue, breathlessness and problems with memory, concentration and other mental functions are very common.'

La actriz luce una melena rubia ondulada en el estreno de su nueva película. GTRES Enfundada en un vestido negro que le sentaba como un guante a su espectacular figura y dando protagonismo absoluto a su nuevo cabello, la actriz cambiaba su habitual melena castaña natural con flequillo a la que tenía acostumbrada a sus seguidores por un cabello rubio con corte desfilado, ondulado y en un tono de lo más favorecedor. Se trata de lo que los expertos denominan 'tiramisu blonde', un tono rubio muy rompedor que se ha convertido en uno de los más solicitados de la temporada. Bautizado en honor al famoso dulce gracias a su apariencia, con unas raíces oscuras que recuerdan a la capa superior del famoso pastel, mientras que de largos a puntas logra tonalidades que van desde el color del café más oscuro a las más rubias.

423311955,"NEWPORT Ore. (KPTV) - A young man is recovering after getting into a serious car accident. His family says while they’re thankful he’s alive, they’re concerned about how he’s going to be able to provide for himself while he recovers. See Also: Suspect taken into custody in Gaston after chase, shooting 20-year-old Jacob Day’s father, Chris, explained that his son went to pick up his friend in Newport. The plan was to bring him to the airport in Portland, but on their way back a driver pulled out in front of them at highway speeds and they hit them head on. Chris Day said that’s when Jacob’s friend, who was unharmed in the crash, called him. “I just told the kid, ‘put my kid on the phone. Let me talk to my son.’ Frantically, he says, ‘Dad, I’m hurt pretty bad. I need you to get here as soon as you can.’” Chris believes the driver of the truck who pulled out onto the highway in front of his son saw the car just ahead of him exit. He is under the impression they were unaware his 20-year-old was behind them, leading to the crash, and “deploying the airbags and making his car completely useless.” He said first responders arrived quickly to help his son but had a hard time getting him out of the car because of an injury to his hip. Due to a pre-existing medical issue, he also explained that Jacob was having difficulty breathing. “I wanted to cry,” he recalled. “You just kind of go into fight or flight mode and want to be there with them. Honestly, I couldn’t figure out what to do fast enough, but to get up and get dressed and go.” Jacob was taken to a hospital in Newport, where his father said doctors had trouble stabilizing his injured leg. He was then life-flighted to Portland’s Legacy Emmanuel hospital, where he would spend several days until there was room for him in surgery. Day said following the surgery, Jacob seems to be doing okay now. However, making a full recovery could take years and he can’t do much to provide for his girlfriend and her child while recovering. “He was the sole provider for them,” Day said, “and so he’s pretty much stuck.” Day went on to say his son is usually full of energy. But he’s been having a hard time since the crash, which he said has been burned into Jacob’s memory. “He’s been having nightmares since the accident,” he said, “and he doesn’t really want to get in a car.” Day said this is Jacob’s fourth trip to the hospital this year, and he feels like his son just can’t catch a break.

After seeing photos of the wreck, Day said he feels blessed that his son’s alive. “I just can’t describe how lucky I am that he’s still here with us.” Day said his son is trying to figure out what his next steps are, and the friend who was also in the car accident, set up a GoFundMe for him to help him while he has no choice but to be away from work. Day would also like to caution drivers to just take an extra second to look before pulling out. Copyright 2023 KPTV-KPDX.

Давайте разберемся, насколько полезен каждый из напитков. Пейте сок и будьте здоровы! Все свежие соки содержат в себе большое количество витаминов и минералов, которые быстро усваиваются человеческим организмом. В набор продуктов на 1-й и 2-й ступенях гиполипидемической диеты, направленной на нормализацию уровня холестерина в крови, входят фруктовые соки без добавленного сахара, а в период обострения подагры назначается диета, состоящая преимущественно из жидкой пищи, в том числе из овощных и фруктовых соков. Кроме того, когда мы выжимаем из свежего фрукта или овоща сок, то удаляем из них клетчатку и получаем в одном стакане жидкость с витаминами и очень высокой концентрацией сахара (пусть и натурального). В этом случае организм недополучает клетчатку, которая вызывает чувство насыщения, снижает риск сердечных заболеваний и уменьшает уровень холестерина. Поэтому в соковыжималке имеет смысл выставлять режим «с мякотью». Морс — витаминный концентрат. Калорийность морса вариативна и зависит от того, сколько сахара или меда было положено в напиток. Но в целом можно назвать рассматриваемый напиток диетическим продуктом — с его помощью даже устраивают разгрузочные дни. Полезные свойства морса зависят от того, из каких ягод или фруктов он изготовлен. Например, брусничный морс стимулирует выделение желудочного сока и улучшает аппетит, морс из клюквы снижает температуру, помогает в лечении заболеваний мочеполовой системы, при гипертонии, анемии и атеросклерозе. Он мягко воздействует на организм, не обжигая слизистую кислотой, как это могут делать соки и другие напитки. Морсы противопоказаны детям до 6 месяцев, так как могут вызвать аллергию. А компот? Компоты утоляют жажду, насыщают витаминами, способствуют укреплению иммунитета, ускоряют метаболизм и имеют еще множество полезных свойств, которые определяются составом ингредиентов. Компот из сухофруктов повышает работоспособность организма и укрепляет иммунитет. Высушенные яблоки и груши ускоряют метаболизм, снижают внутричерепное давление. Курага и чернослив нормализуют стул за счет улучшения перистальтики кишечника. Ограничение в употреблении компота заключается в обилии активных веществ в нем. Преобладание кислых ягод в отваре может вызвать дискомфорт в желудке у людей с заболеваниями ЖКТ. Красная смородина, вишня, клюква, крыжовник и ежевика противопоказаны при дисфункции печени, воспалениях слизистой оболочки пищеварительного тракта (гастрите, язве, колите, дуодените). Данные фрукты содержат агрессивные органические кислоты, которые могут спровоцировать приступ боли, повышение секреции соляной кислоты, желудочные колики, диарею. Компот — достаточно калорийный напиток из-за содержащегося в нем сахара. В обычном виде его не рекомендуется пить людям с сахарным диабетом. Для них необходимо готовить компоты без сахара или заменять его некалорийными подсластителями и заменителями. Помните, что любой из данных напитков будет полезнее, если вы приготовили его сами из фруктов или ягод и добавили минимум сахара, а еще лучше — обошлись без него.

423309714,"TOKYO (AP) -- A British army veteran who fought and survived one of his country's harshest battles known as the Burma Campaign against the Japanese during World War II traveled to Japan to lay flowers at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier at a memorial ceremony on Monday to stress the importance of reconciliation. Richard Day, 97, who survived the decisive 1944 Battle of Kohima in northeast India -- where Japan fought to capture the then British-controlled territory -- stood up from a wheelchair, placed a wreath of red flowers on a table and saluted the souls of the unknown Japanese soldiers at Tokyo's Cihdorigafuchi National Cemetery. 'It was very moving, but it brought back some terrible memories,' Day said after the ceremony. When he was laying flowers, he said, 'I was remembering the screams of people ... they were crying out after their mothers.' He shook hands at the memorial and later conversed with relatives of the Japanese veterans who also attended the event. 'You can't carry hate,' Day said. '(Otherwise) You are not hating each other, you are hurting yourself.' Day was in his late teens when he was sent to the notoriously severe battle, where he also faced harsh conditions, including contracting malaria and dysentery simultaneously while fighting the Japanese. About 160,000 Japanese were killed during the battle, many from starvation and illnesses due to insufficient supplies and planning. Some 50,000 British and Commonwealth troops were also killed, nearly half of whom perished in brutal prison camps. Hard feelings toward Japan's brutal treatment of prisoners of war remained in Britain years after the fighting ended. Yukihiko Torikai, a Tokai University professor of humanities and culture came on behalf of his grandfather Tsuneo Torikai who returned from the campaign alive after his supervisor ordered a withdrawal. The university professor shook hands with Day, expressing his appreciation of the British veteran's trip to Japan. He later said he is aware not everyone is ready for reconciliation and that it would have been even better if a Japanese veteran who survived the battle could come. 'As we foster friendship, it is important to remember the past, not just putting it behind,' Torikai said. Military officials from the embassies in Tokyo of former allied countries, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia attended the ceremony. Event organizer Akiko Macdonald, the daughter of a Japanese veteran who also survived the Battle of Kohima and now heads the London-based Burma Campaign Society, said the joint memorial in Japan for those lost in the battles of Kohima and Imphal was especially meaningful. Day was also set to visit and pray at Yokohama War Cemetary, where many of the buried were POWs, as well as Yamagata, Hiroshima. He also wanted to visit Kyoto to find the hotel where he stayed while on postwar duties to thank them for their hospitality.",9578,tokyo ap british army veteran fight survive country harsh battle know burma campaign japanese world war ii travel japan lay flower tomb unknown soldier memorial ceremony monday stress importance reconciliation richard day survive decisive battle kohima northeast india japan fight capture british control territory stand wheelchair place wreath red flower table salute soul unknown japanese soldier tokyo cihdorigafuchi national cemetery moving bring terrible memory day say ceremony lay flower say remember scream people cry mother shake hand memorial later converse relative japanese veteran attend event carry hate day say hate hurt day late teen send notoriously severe battle face harsh condition include contract malaria dysentery simultaneously fight japanese japanese kill battle starvation illness insufficient supply planning british commonwealth troop kill nearly half perish brutal prison camp hard feeling japan brutal treatment prisoner war remain britain year fighting end yukihiko torikai tokai university professor humanity culture come behalf grandfather tsuneo torikai return campaign alive supervisor order withdrawal university professor shake hand day express appreciation british veteran trip japan later say aware ready reconciliation well japanese veteran survive battle come foster friendship important remember past put torikai say military official embassy tokyo allied country include united states new zealand australia attend ceremony event organizer akiko macdonald daughter japanese veteran survive battle kohima head london base burma campaign society say joint memorial japan lose battle kohima imphal especially meaningful day set visit pray yokohama war cemetary bury pows yamagata hiroshima want visit kyoto find hotel stay postwar duty thank hospitality
423309997,"О пользе томатной пасты. © Марина Славина / Фотобанк Лори Расскажут ведущие программы «Формула еды» в субботу, 14 октября, на телеканале «Россия-1». Сорок второй выпуск передачи о лучших российских продуктах будет посвящен томатной пасте. Ведущие Сергей Агапкин и Сесиль Плеже посетят Астраханскую область, чтобы узнать, как производят пасту и чем она полезна. Томатная паста богата витаминами и минералами. В ней много витамина С, который поддерживает иммунитет и защищает от инфекций; витаминов группы В, участвующих в работе центральной нервной системы и головного мозга и необходимых для функционирования кровеносной и сердечно-сосудистой системы; Е – «витамина красоты», отвечающего за здоровье кожи и волос. В томатной пасте содержится ликопин – каротиноидный пигмент. Именно он придает томатам такой яркий красный цвет. Ликопин защищает клетки кожи от разрушающего действия ультрафиолетовых лучей, замедляет процессы старения и регулирует ее пигментацию. Паста – прекрасный источник кобальта, калия, магния, железа, меди, молибдена и некоторых других элементов. Однако у томатной пасты есть и противопоказания. В ней много органических кислот (лимонная, яблочная, щавелевая, салициловая и другие), которые могут оказывать раздражающее влияние на слизистую оболочку органов желудка и кишечника. Поэтому ее не рекомендуется есть при обострении хронических заболеваний ЖКТ, при повышенной кислотности желудка, язве, гастрите. Подробнее о продукте расскажут в программе «Формула еды». В конце, как обычно, вас ждет интересный и полезный рецепт. Не пропустите: суббота, 14 октября, в 09:00, телеканал «Россия-1». Справка. Тема здорового питания продолжает быть важной и привлекает интерес все большего количества людей. Проект «Формула еды» призван рассказать об этом увлекательно, достоверно и доступно. Программа подготовлена в рамках проекта «Укрепление общественного здоровья» нацпроекта «Демография» при консультационной поддержке Роспотребнадзора и ФГБУН «ФИЦ питания и биотехнологии».

423309471,"Hannover. In Linden-Mitte in einer Johanniter-Einrichtung im Gilde Carré sitzt am Montag eine betagte Frau an einem schön gedeckten Frühstückstisch. Vor ihr liegt das Neue Testament. Die Heilige Schrift interessiert sie gerade aber nicht, sie sieht sie noch nicht einmal. Was sie gerade sieht, ist eine Almwiese mit saftigem Grün und friedlichen Kühen. Sie ist glücklich. „Das ist toll', wiederholt sie mantraartig. Dass sie so fröhlich ist, ist nicht selbstverständlich: Sie ist an Demenz erkrankt. Über ihrem Gesicht befindet sich ein eckiger grauer Kasten, der fast genauso groß ist wie ihr eigener Kopf: eine Virtual-Reality-Brille. Die Johanniter wollen mit dem Einsatz solcher VR-Brillen demenzkranken Menschen und Menschen im Hospiz das Reisen an Sehnsuchtsorte ermöglichen – wenn auch nur virtuell. Seit einem Jahr sind die Brillen bei den Johannitern im Einsatz. Stationär oder ambulant sollen sie den Patienten Abwechslung bieten – Abwechslung zu den eigenen vier Wänden oder Arztpraxen. „Es geht auch um Entschleunigung. Wir halten hier die Welt an', sagt Anke Rohlfs, Koordinatorin des Projektes. „Ferngucker', nennt sie ihre Patienten. Sie erzählt von einem Bewohner der Wohngemeinschaft „Dorothea', ein Zuhause für Menschen mit Demenz, der die Brille gleich gar nicht mehr absetzten wollte – so gut habe es ihm gefallen. „Schön bunt!' „Das ist ja toll. Wo ist dieses Gelände?', fragt sich eine erstaunte Patientin, die gerade virtuell durch die Herrenhäuser Gärten wandert. Ihr Fazit zur Grotte von Niki de Saint Phalle: „Schön bunt!' Auch Ziele außerhalb von Hannover können bereist werden: Hoch auf die Berge, wandern durch Patagonien, eine Führung durch das größte Kreuzfahrtschiff der Welt oder Meditieren am Strand – die Auswahl ist riesig. Das Projekt ist mit Spenden finanziert. Aktuell besitzt die Einrichtung in Linden zwei VR-Brillen. Weitere werden in der Johanniter-Akademie zur Ausbildung von Notfallsanitätern eingesetzt. Hinter der Technik steckt das Münchner Start-up „Granny Vision'. Das Unternehmen setzt damit auf einen kommenden Markt. In der Sucht- und Traumatherapie kommen Brillen dieser Art bereits häufiger zum Einsatz. Erst virtueller Urlaub, dann Spaziergang. Besonders bei schlechtem Wetter seien die Brillen eine große Hilfe, erklärt Anke Rohlfs. Sie forderten das Gehirn ähnlich wie ein ausgiebiger Spaziergang. Übelkeit oder Ängste bei der Benutzung der Brillen seien noch kein Problem gewesen. Ganz virtuell geht es dann aber auch nicht: Nach einem etwa einstündigen virtuellen Weltenbummel geht es weiter mit einem analogen Wald-Quiz und einem realen Spaziergang zum nahegelegenen echten Spielplatz.

423310860,"Η ανοσοθεραπεία στην ογκολογία-αιματολογία στοχεύει στην ενεργοποίηση των κυττάρων του ανοσοποιητικού συστήματος ώστε να αναγνωρίσουν και να καταστρέψουν τα καρκινικά κύτταρα. Η ανοσοθεραπεία έχει καίριο ρόλο στη σύγχρονη θεραπευτική του πολλαπλού μυελώματος. Πρόσφατα, έλαβαν έγκριση από τον Αμερικανικό Οργανισμό Τροφίμων και Φαρμάκων των ΗΠΑ (FDA) δύο επιπλέον φάρμακα ανοσοθεραπείας (το talquetamab και το elranatamab). Πρόκειται για δύο αμφι-ειδικά αντισώματα για τη θεραπεία ασθενών με υποτροπιάζον/ανθεκτικό πολλαπλούν μυέλωμα. Τα αντισώματα αυτά ονομάζονται αμφι-ειδικά καθώς προσδένονται αφενός με τα Τ-λεμφοκύτταρα του ανοσοποιητικού συστήματος και αφετέρου με τα κύτταρα του πολλαπλού μυελώματος, ενεργοποιώντας τα Τ-λεμφοκύτταρα ώστε να στραφούν έναντι των κυττάρων του μυελώματος. Τα δύο νέα αμφι-ειδικά αντισώματα προστίθενται στη θεραπευτική φαρέτρα, επιπλέον του ήδη εγκεκριμένου αμφι-ειδικού αντισώματος teclistamab, το οποίο ενδείκνυται για ασθενείς με υποτροπιάζον/ανθεκτικό πολλαπλούν μυέλωμα που έχουν λάβει τουλάχιστον 3 προηγούμενες γραμμές θεραπείας. Βέβαια, η μελλοντική επικύρωση της πλήρης έγκρισης αυτών των φαρμάκων εναπόκειται στην επαλήθευση του κλινικού τους οφέλους σε μεγαλύτερες κλινικές δοκιμές.  Το talquetamab δεσμεύει τα Τ-λεμφοκύτταρα μέσω της σύνδεσης του υποδοχέα CD3 στην επιφάνεια Τ-λεμφοκυττάρων και από την άλλη αναγνωρίζει τον υποδοχέα GPRC5D στην επιφάνεια των κυττάρων του μυελώματος. Χορηγείται κάθε μία ή δύο εβδομάδες ως υποδόρια ένεση μετά από μια αρχική φάση κλιμάκωσης της δόσης. Η κλινική μελέτη φάσης 2 MonumenTAL-1 περιέλαβε ασθενείς που είχαν λάβει τουλάχιστον τέσσερις προηγούμενες γραμμές θεραπεία και το συνολικό ποσοστό ανταπόκρισης στη δόση των 0,8 mg/kg υποδόριας χορήγησης κάθε 2 εβδομάδες ανήλθε στο 73,6% των ασθενών, ενώ οι ανταποκρίσεις ήταν διατηρήσιμες. Το elranatamab είναι ένα άλλο αμφι-ειδικό αντίσωμα που χορηγείται επίσης υποδορίως σε εβδομαδιαία βάση και προσδένεται αφενός με τον υποδοχέα CD3 των Τ-λεμφοκυττάρων και το αντιγόνο BCMA στα κύτταρα του μυελώματος. Η έγκριση του φαρμάκου βασίστηκε στα αποτελέσματα της κλινικής δοκιμής φάσης 2 MagnetisMM-3, η οποία συμπεριέλαβε ασθενείς με υποτροπιάζον / ανθεκτικό μυέλωμα που είχαν λάβει τουλάχιστον τέσσερις προηγούμενες γραμμές θεραπείας, συμπεριλαμβανομένου ενός αναστολέα πρωτεασώματος, ενός ανοσοτροποποιητικού παράγοντα και ενός μονοκλωνικού αντισώματος έναντι του CD38 και το συνολικό ποσοστό ανταπόκρισης ανήλθε σε 58%, επίσης διατηρήσιμων ανταποκρίσεων. Τα αμφι-ειδικά αντισώματα όμως έχουν και ένα ειδικό προφίλ ανεπιθύμητων ενεργειών και γι΄αυτό η χορήγησή τους και η παρακολούθηση των ασθενών θα πρέπει να γίνονται σε έμπειρα και εξειδικευμένα κέντρα. Οι πιο συχνές αντιδράσεις που καταγράφηκαν στις μελέτες των αμφι-ειδικών αντισωμάτων συμπεριελάμβαναν σύνδρομο απελευθέρωσης κυτοκινών, αιματολογική τοξικότητα (αναιμία, μειωμένος αριθμός λευκών αιμοσφαιρίων, ουδετεροφίλων, λεμφοκυττάρων και αιμοπεταλίων), πυρετό, δυσγευσία, διαταραχή των ονύχων, μυοσκελετικά άλγη, αντιδράσεις στο σημείο της έγχυσης, εξάνθημα και άλλες δερματολογικές διαταραχές, καταβολή, απώλεια βάρους, διάρροια, κεφαλαλγία. Η ανοσοκαταστολή και οι λοιμώξεις, κυρίως του αναπνευστικού συστήματος, αποτελούν συχνή επιπλοκή της θεραπείας με αμφι-ειδικά αντισώματα.

423308521,"Herring with garlic and terrible nausea: Musulbes, who broke up with Kapakli, no longer hides her special situation. 2023-10-11 05:35:51. The star of 'House-2' Tatyana Musulbes continues to enjoy the hospitality of her pregnant friend. But it seems that she is no longer too welcome in Pinchuk’s house. After breaking up with Roman Kapakly, heartbroken Tatyana Musulbes unexpectedly moved into the house of her friend Irina Pinchuk. Fans believed that she would stay under the wing of her friend for a couple of days to come to her senses, but that was not the case. Musulbes was clearly delayed. Now people are not only worried about the head of the family, Arai Chobanyan, whose apartment is being walked around by that same predator, but they are also amazed at the girl’s impudence. In her personal microblog on Instagram*, Tatyana regularly talks about how she lives in someone else’s nest. The girl looks quite satisfied and happy and is happy that her friend is clarifying when she will return home today. But it seems that I’m already pretty tired of taking care of my dear guest Pinchuk. The day before, a very strange dinner awaited Musulbes, who returned from manicure procedures. On her page, the blogger showed bottles of beer, herring, vacuum-packed smoked mackerel, onions, garlic and Borodino bread. 'Now more pike caviar will arrive,' Musulbes said. The star friends dined on all this – the hostess of the house clearly had no leisure time the day before to cook and create a special atmosphere for the guest. In the microblog of Tatiana Musulbes However, Tatyana was extremely pleased with such a strange 'fish' dinner. Let us remember that she was previously suspected of being pregnant by Roman Kapakly, and such special eating habits have now only strengthened some in this opinion. In addition, a few hours later, Musulbes reported that after dinner she began to feel terribly sick. ▼ sources.

423308215,"Warszawa. Pijany przyjechał mężczyznę na skuterze. W niedzielę wieczorem (8 października) strażnicy miejscy patrolowali okolice ul. Szaserów i Chłopickiego. W pewnym momencie zauważyli grupę ludzi. Krzyczeli i machali w ich kierunku. Funkcjonariusze postanowili zatrzymać radiowóz. W trakcie rozmowy z mundurowymi okazało się, że zaledwie kilka minut wcześniej doszło tam do potwornego potrącenia skuterzysty . Mężczyzna leżał w pasie zieleni, 200 metrów dalej, a przechodnie zablokowali możliwość dalszej jazdy sprawcy wypadku. Na miejsce wezwano policję oraz pogotowie ratunkowe. Jeden ze strażników pilnował sprawcy, a drugi podbiegł do poszkodowanego, aby udzielić mu pomocy przed przyjazdem karetki. Rannym okazał się być 30-letnim obywatel Turkmenistanu. Mężczyzna miał zawroty głowy, był przytomny, skarżył się na ból brzucha i kręgosłupa w odcinku szyjnym. Sprawca został ujęty przez funkcjonariuszy i umieszczony w przedziale przewozowym radiowozu. – Od mężczyzny czuć było alkohol, twierdził, że wypił 3 piwa . Musiały być bardzo mocne, bo badanie alkomatem, wykonane nieco później przez policję wykazało 2,5 promila alkoholu w wydychanym powietrzu. Sprawca wypadku został zatrzymany przez policję. Było to możliwe dzięki godnej pochwały obywatelskiej postawie świadków zdarzenia – poinformował w komunikacie referat prasowy straży miejskiej.",9578,warszawa pijany przyjechał mężczyznę na skuterze w niedzielę wieczorem października strażnicy miejscy patrolowali okolice ul szaserów chłopickiego w pewnym momencie zauważyli grupę ludzi krzyczeli machali w ich kierunku funkcjonariusze postanowili zatrzymać radiowóz w trakcie rozmowy z mundurowymi okazało się że zaledwie kilka minut wcześniej doszło tam potwornego potrącenia skuterzysty mężczyzna leżał w pasie zieleni metrów dalej przechodnie zablokowali możliwość dalszej jazdy sprawcy wypadku na miejsce wezwano policję oraz pogotowie ratunkowe jeden ze strażników pilnował sprawcy drugi podbiegł poszkodowanego aby udzielić mu pomocy prze przyjazdem karetki rannym okazał się być letnim obywatel turkmenistanu mężczyzna miał zawroty głowy był przytomny skarżył się na ból brzucha kręgosłupa w odcinku szyjnym sprawca został ujęty przez funkcjonariuszy umieszczony w przedziale przewozowym radiowozu od mężczyzny czuć było alkohol twierdził że wypił piwa musiały być bardzo mocne bo badanie alkomatem wykonane nieco później przez policję wykazało promila alkoholu w wydychanym powietrzu sprawca wypadku został zatrzymany przez policję było możliwe dzięki godnej pochwały obywatelskiej postawie świadków zdarzenia poinformował w komunikacie referat prasowy straży miejskiej
423309078,"Probiotics have been widely used in gastroenteritis due to acute and chronic illnesses. However, evidence supporting the effectiveness of probiotics in different health conditions is inconclusive and conflicting. The aim of this study was to review the existing literature on the effects of probiotics on gastroenteritis among adults. Only original articles on clinical trials that demonstrated the effects of probiotics in adults with gastroenteritis were used for this analysis. Multiple databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE and Scopus databases, were searched for the data. The study followed standard procedures for data extraction using a PRISMA flow chart. A quality appraisal of the selected studies was conducted using CADIMA. Finally, a meta-analysis was performed. Thirty-five articles met the selection criteria; of them, probiotics were found effective in the treatment and/or prevention of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease in 17 (49%), and the treatment of pouchitis in 4 (11.4%), antibiotic-induced diarrhea in 3 (8.6%), Helicobacter pylori infection in 2 (5.7%) and diverticulitis in 1 (2.9%), while the remaining 7 (20%) were ineffective, and 1 study’s results were inconclusive. The meta-analysis did not demonstrate any significant protective effects of probiotics. Having a 2 value of zero and I 2 of 6%, the studies were homogeneous and had minimum variances. Further studies are suggested to evaluate the beneficial effects of probiotics in IBDs and other chronic bowel diseases.",9578,probiotic widely gastroenteritis acute chronic illness evidence support effectiveness probiotic different health condition inconclusive conflicting aim study review exist literature effect probiotic gastroenteritis adult original article clinical trial demonstrate effect probiotic adult gastroenteritis analysis multiple database pubmed google scholar medline scopus database search datum study follow standard procedure datum extraction prisma flow chart quality appraisal select study conduct cadima finally meta analysis perform thirty article meet selection criterion probiotic find effective treatment prevention chronic inflammatory bowel disease ibd include ulcerative colitis crohn disease treatment pouchitis antibiotic induce diarrhea helicobacter pylori infection diverticulitis remain ineffective study result inconclusive meta analysis demonstrate significant protective effect probiotic have value zero study homogeneous minimum variance study suggest evaluate beneficial effect probiotic ibd chronic bowel disease
