Proven experience in conflict contexts and insecure environments, with consequent experience in supporting emergency response. Experience of team management. Previous experience in Afghanistan would be an asset. Excellent communication, organizational and prioritization skills and the ability to multi-task and support and/or fill multiple positions at one time. High leadership and management abilities, and particularly team management skills and capacities to provide distance technical support. Significant knowledge and experience of grant writing and management for major institutional donors, including EU, BHA/USAID, ECHO, UN Agencies (UNHCR, UNICEF, etc.) and pooled funding mechanisms, such as CHF.

Ability to work under stress/pressure and meet tight deadlines. Willingness to work in complex and volatile environments. Language: Fluent in English, written and spoken.

A salaried position: According to experience, starting from EUR 2860 gross per month (2600 base salary + 10% annual leave allowance paid monthly) and a monthly Per Diem of USD 600. Starting from August 1st, 2023 onwards, the basic gross salary will be increased to 2800€/month as part of a review of the salary grid.

While the risks associated with the conflict between the government and the armed opposition have significantly decreased since 15th of August 2022, third party armed groups (notably ISKP) continue to operate in certain provinces including Kabul and the possibility of the emergence of new opposition groups cannot be ignored. On the other hand, the country has always witnessed a certain level of criminality. The Deputy Country Director is living in a shared guesthouse with the other international staffs. Living conditions are quite fair in Kabul, with possible access to all essential goods and services. The security situation can be tense, and travel is sometimes restricted, but it is possible to have a social life. Living conditions in the field are often harsher (limited access to electricity, harsher weather conditions, isolation, etc.) with paradoxically, depending on the area, less strict security conditions.

Pour ce premier semestre de l'année 2023, voilà un aperçu de nos actions. En étroite collaboration avec la Croix-Rouge Nigérienne (CRN), le CICR s'est employé à répondre aux besoins dans un contexte humanitaire caractérisé où les besoins des communautés affectées ne font que s'accroitre en raison de plusieurs chocs. Dans cette situation, les personnes déplacées sont les plus vulnérables. Le CICR leur vient en aide d'urgence en leur distribuant des kits de bien essentiel de ménage et en soutenant leurs productions agricoles. Ainsi : 9 562 personnes déplacés appuyés en kits EHI (bien essentiels de ménages), 43 043 personnes déplacés ou refugiées soutenus à la production agricole. Dans le cadre de l'amélioration de la santé, le CICR soutient les centres de santé intégrés (CSI) et les hôpitaux dans les zones affectées par les conflits armés pour faciliter l'accès aux soins de santé primaires, la prise en charge des blessés par arme et des urgences vitales. Dans ce sens, 130 340 Personnes ont bénéficié de soins de santé aux CSI soutenus par le CICR; 1 358 Personnes ont reçu des soins d’urgences vitales. L'action du CICR ne se limite pas aux réponses d'urgence. Il assiste aussi les populations affectées afin de garantir leur sécurité économique. Cette assistance vise à permettre aux populations affectées de subvenir aux besoins de leurs familles, et se traduit de plusieurs manières à savoir : garantir la bonne santé du bétail car l'élevage et l'agriculture sont les principales sources de revenu des populations, mettre en uvre des activités génératrices de revenus; prioriser le travail rémunéré, (cash for work) etc. 3 96 244 têtes d’animaux appartenant à 94 612 ménages ont été vaccinées, 9 366 personnes appuyés dans le cadre de cash for work à Diffa et Tahoua pour la réalisation de bandes pares-feux et de désensablement de parcs de vaccination.",

For each FEWS NET country and region, the Price Bulletin provides a set of charts showing monthly prices in the current marketing year in selected urban centers and allowing users to compare current trends with both five-year average prices, indicative of seasonal trends, and prices in the previous year. Locally-produced rice is the most important staple food for households in northern and central Madagascar. Imported rice is a less-preferred substitute, but often consumed by poor households because it is cheaper than locally-produced rice and expands more during the cooking. Dried cassava is the primary staple food in the south, although it is consumed in other parts of the country during the lean season when household food stocks are low. Maize is the third most important staple and the second most consumed cereal in Madagascar. Antananarivo, the capital city, is the largest urban market and is the major hub for the country’s staple food trade networks. Antananarivo is a net consumer of staple food and is supplied by imports arriving through the port of Toamasina and from key surplus producing areas throughout the country. Antsirabe, the second urban market, is located in the surplus rice-producing Vakinankaratra region and one of the markets that supply Antananarivo. Located on the eastern coast, Toamasina is the main port city of Madagascar where major quantity of imported commodities comes before traded throughout the country. The southern Madagascar including Ambovombe, Tsihombe, Amboasary and Fianarantsoa markets are the main providers of cassava and maize.",

          "fullText": "Heavy El Nino rains have already devastated parts of Somalia, particularly Baidoa; 107,000 people in Baidoa were affected by recent flooding, 86,700 internally displaced makeshift houses were destroyed; More than 12,000 cases of cholera have already been detected in Kenya, with more anticipated if floods hit. Nairobi, Kenya, October 11, 2023 The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is sounding an alarm following heavy flooding in parts of Somalia, particularly Baidoa in the southwest, and a warning issued by the Kenyan Meteorological Department (KMD) predicting heavy rainfall across numerous regions of Kenya from October this year through January 2024. Swift and substantial funding is critical to avert childhood malnutrition, protect livelihoods, and strengthen resilience programming for refugees and host communities in Kenya and riverine populations across Somalia. In Somalia, the IRC is set to activate a Crisis Modifier under a Nexus Project funded by the German Federal Foreign Office. The Modifier aims to provide crucial support to communities in flood-prone areas along the Hiraan region, to implement interventions geared towards mitigating the impact of flooding and delivering crucial aid to communities affected by conflict. The lack of sufficient funding to address the impacts of El Niño and of preparatory action could exacerbate the strain already placed on the humanitarian system. The 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan for Somalia is currently only 37-percent funded. In Baidoa, the epicentre of a hunger crisis following the last few years of drought, heavy flooding has already caused significant disruption to the city and poses a risk to the safety and well-being of the residents, particularly people currently living in internally displaced (IDP) camps. 107,000 people in Baidoa have been impacted by the floods on October 4. Further flooding is expected across Somalia, which is estimated to impact 1.2 million people who reside in riverine areas. This adds to the on-going humanitarian crisis in Somalia where more than 3.7 million people are experiencing extreme hunger. This number is expected to increase to 4.3 million between October and December 2023, in part due to the impact of flooding caused by El Niño. In Kenya, it's predicted that the impact of floods could leave more than 2 million people in need of some form of direct assistance. Of this number, around 600,000 are anticipated to be refugees, exacerbating the existing humanitarian crisis in the country, where 4.5 million people are currently facing hunger. Kurt Tjossem, IRC Regional Vice President for East Africa, said- 'We are operating in refugee camps and camps for displaced people where vulnerable populations are already grappling with disease outbreaks, and the healthcare system is stretched to its limits. After three years of devastating drought, this rainfall may initially be seen as a blessing for farmers and pastoralists in both Somalia and Kenya, however, it has the potential to quickly turn into a disaster as we see in Baidoa, with widespread flooding anticipated in the areas where the IRC operates. Since October 2022, Kenya's arid northern region has been grappling with a cholera outbreak triggered by a prolonged and severe drought, resulting in over 12,000 cases and 202 deaths as of September 15th. Disrupting rainfall patterns will severely affect agriculture, rural livelihoods, and food security, placing farmers and pastoralists at the forefront of its impact. In addition to supporting communities through emergency response, these floods highlight the need for anticipatory action measures, which must focus on safeguarding food, crops, water, and infrastructure to protect the food supply and support communities to prepare and respond to the anticipated flooding. We all remember the last El Niño in 2015/16, which resulted in landslides, flash floods, and building collapses. If immediate measures are not taken, the consequences to lives and livelihoods could be dire.' The IRC calls for prepositioned, flexible, multi-year financing to strengthen the El Niño response. In Kenya and Somalia, the IRC is conducting awareness-raising campaigns to prevent disease outbreaks; delivering critical supplies including hygiene and cash; enhancing water and hygiene infrastructure in anticipation of the floods; and deploying mobile health units to provide essential health services. East Africa is home to some of the IRC’s longest-running programs globally, with operations in Somalia for over 40 years, Kenya for 30 years and Ethiopia for 20 years. Today, over 2,000 IRC staff in the region are scaling up our programs to address the current drought and rising food insecurity, including expanding to new areas to meet severe needs.

Pour chaque FEWS NET pays et la région, le Bulletin des prix fournit un ensemble de tableaux indiquant les prix mensuels à la campagne en cours dans certains centres urbains et en permettant aux utilisateurs de comparer les tendances actuelles à la fois les prix de cinq ans en moyenne, une indication des tendances saisonnières, et les prix l'année précédente. Le riz produit localement est l'aliment de base le plus important pour les ménages du nord et du centre de Madagascar. Le riz importé est un substitut moins préféré, mais souvent consommé par les ménages pauvres, car il est moins cher que le riz produit localement et augmente de volume pendant la cuisson. Le manioc séché est l'aliment de base principal dans le sud, bien qu'il soit consommé dans d'autres régions du pays pendant la saison de soudure lorsque les stocks alimentaires des ménages sont faibles.p Le maïs est le troisième aliment de base le plus important et la deuxième céréale la plus consommée à Madagascar. Les récoltes de céréales et de tubercules ont généralement lieu entre mai et juillet. Le pic de la principale période de soudure est en mois de février. Antananarivo, la capitale, est le plus grand marché urbain et constitue la plaque tournante principale pour les réseaux de commerce de produits alimentaires de base du pays.

          "fullText": "Highlights Another 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck Herat Province, western Afghanistan on the morning of 11 October. One person was reportedly killed, and an estimated 140 people injured in the earthquake, which struck 28 kilometres northwest of Herat City. Those injured from Herat City and Injil district were referred to Herat Regional Hospital and private healthcare facilities. Several villages across Gulran, Injil and Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai districts are understood to have sustained significant damage in the earthquake; humanitarian partners are mobilizing to assess the impact. This latest major earthquake comes just four days after the first 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck roughly the same area of Herat Province. Assessments completed to date indicate that 11,066 people (1,835 families) have been affected across Zindajan (1,398 families), Gulran (295 families), Kushk / Rabat-e-Sangai (123) and Kohsan (19 families) districts. Informal reports estimate a further 6,000 people (1,000 families) have been affected in Injil district the epicentre of this morning’s earthquake. Areas newly affected by today’s earthquake will also need to be assessed. The number of those directly and indirectly affected is expected to rise. Some 1,714 homes across Zindajan (1,373), Gulran (295) and Kushk/Rabat-e-Sangai (46) districts are reported to have been completely destroyed in Saturday’s earthquake. Homes have also been severely and moderately damaged across Kushk/Rabat-e-Sangai (77), Zindajan (23) and Kohsan (19) districts. More than 290 livestock were also lost. To date, assessments have identified 38 unaccompanied minors and 24 unaccompanied elderly persons across both Zindajan and Kushk districts. Some 138 female-headed households were also identified in Gulran, Kohsan, Kushk and Zindajan districts. Additionally, 650 people are reported to have had their Tazkeras (civil paperwork) destroyed, all in Zindajan district. On 10 October, the Humanitarian Coordinator (a.i.) for Afghanistan, Daniel Endres, visited Zindajan district along with the representatives of IOM, OCHA and WHO, to meet with affected communities and to better understand the extent of the damage caused by the 7 October earthquake. In line with the scaled-up response efforts, the international community has also stepped up its support for affected populations. On 10 October, ECHO announced a €3.5 million earthquake response package to Afghanistan, while several donors have also announced new contributions to the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund totalling around US $9 million (Germany, €5 million; Switzerland, €2.5 million; Australia, AUD $1 million; Ireland, €500,000; and Japan, US $100,000). Additional donor contributions are anticipated. Humanitarian Needs and Response. Humanitarian partners continue to coordinate with the de-facto authorities (DfA), including the Provincial Governor, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation, and the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), as well as their respective departments at the sub-national level. Damaged housing, plus the fear of returning home due to persistent aftershocks, have resulted in the sprouting of several informal sites across Herat City. IOM and the CCCM Working Ground are on the ground assessing the situation amid concerns about the lack of access to basic services. Today’s earthquake has also newly-affected 112 villages across Herat (58), Injil (39), Kushk (8), Karuch (6) and Zindajan (1) districts, bringing the total number of affected villages to 444 since Saturday. In addition to response details outlined in Flash Updates 1, 2 and 3, cluster partners have so far assisted earthquake-affected communities with the following. Emergency Shelter (ES) and Non-Food Items (NFI) : IOM, UNHCR, and UNICEF have delivered emergency relief assistance including emergency shelter kits, plastic tarpaulin, NFIs, and other supplementary assistance to nearly 1,000 families across eight villages of Zindajan district. This includes the distribution of 965 family tents, 999 standard NFI kits and 500 blankets as supplementary assistance. IOM distributed 715 family tents and standard NFI kits to 715 families across seven villages in Zindajan district including Bultan (100), Mahal Babaji (121), Mahal Wardakah / Kernil (80), Kachkal (25), Sanjab (155), Sar Baland (50), and Sia Ab (184). As of 10 October, UNHCR through partners distributed emergency tents for shelter to 250 families and NFI and core relief item (CRI) packages including hygiene kits and solar lamps to 284 families including 1,190 blankets at Sia Ab, and 55 packages in Asya Barack and Kachkal villages. UNHCR will target providing 2,000 tents and CRIs including 4,000 solar lamps. Distribution of assistance is still ongoing. UNICEF distributed 500 blankets in Mahal Wardakah / Kernil, Nawabad, Sanjab and Sar-i- Asyab villages in Zindajan district, as well as 10 multi-purpose tents for a temporary health centre. UNICEF has also committed to provide 4,000 NFI kits, 1,500 plastic tarpaulins and 750 winter clothing kits in support of the response and in coordination with the Cluster. NRC has dispatched 1,500 blankets to Herat Province and is further expected to provide seasonal cash for heating and fuel to 1,500 families once assessments have been completed. The Cluster has 23 partners working in the province, all involved and supporting community-level assessments currently underway. Food Security & Agriculture : WFP reports over 81.210 metric tons of mixed food commodities were dispatched to various locations, including Nayeb Rafi and Sia Ab villages in Zindajan district, Gulran Botan village in Gulran district, Herat Regional Hospital, Gazergah Transit Centre (GTC) and several smaller hospitals. The food targeted about 1,290 households (9,000 beneficiaries). WFP also erected two mobile storage units as distribution hubs in Zindajan district and have deployed a team to provide telecommunication facilities as local networks were disrupted by the earthquake. IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation is providing 200 hot meals in Zindajan district. Organization of the Coordination of Humanitarian Relief (OCHR), a WFP partner, conducted a rapid needs assessment in Herat and Baghdis provinces and identified food as an urgent priority. In addition, FAO reports livestock treatment/animal feed/conditional cash inputs were provided to beneficiaries in Qala-e-Naw, Qadis & Muqur districts, Badghis Province, along with livelihood support to beneficiaries in Injil district, Herat Province. Health : By 10 October, the Health Cluster partners reached 5,625 earthquake-affected people in Zindajan (3,704), Injil (836) and Herat (1,085) districts. More than 4,110 people have received primary health care and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services; 1,013 people have received trauma care and rehabilitation services, and 496 people have received different kits (mama and baby kits, dignity kits, individual clean delivery kits) and tarpaulin sheets. On 11 October, 19 mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNTs) were deployed to 20 affected villages of Gulran Khosan, and Zindajan districts. In Zindajan district, 17 MHNTs were deployed to Asyabadk, Chahak Mirandaziha, Charcheshma, Cheshma Ghoori, Ghar Mooshak, Kachkal, Koshkak, Lakasang, Mahal Wardakah / Kernil, Nayeb Rafi, Qasr-e-Shirin, Sarboland, Sia Ab, Sanjab and Siha villages. In Khosan district, one MHNT was deployed to Ahmadabad village, and in Gulran district, one MHNT to Butan village. These MHNTs will provide primary health care and MHPSS services in the shelters as static sites. At the same time, 30 MHNTs from World Vision (6), CARE (2), IRC (6), IRW (6), IOM (2), AADA (3), and Jhpiego (5) are on standby to deploy as needed. In addition, provincial medical associations in Balkh and Nangarhar provinces have donated medicines and cash worth more than US $23,000 (AFN 1,750,000) towards the Herat earthquake response. To address the immediate maternal and reproductive health (MRH) needs of the affected population, UNFPA and its partners provided five mobile health teams (MHTs) to provide services in Koshkak, Mahal Wardakah / Kernil, Nayeb Rafi, Sar Beland and Sia Aab villages of Zindajan district. In addition, two MHTs through UNFPA implementing partner HealthNet TPO provided lifesaving MRH services to the villages of Nayeb Rafi and Sia Aab in Zindajan district reaching 1,744 people. Some 1,027 blankets were also distributed. WHO also dispatched an additional 25 metric tons of supplies to Herat Province including medicines for trauma care, pneumonia, and treatment of severe malnutrition; orthopaedics and surgery equipment; basic hygiene supplies and personal protective equipment for health workers. The package further included 11 inter-agency emergency health kits (IEHK) and 65 trauma and emergency surgery kits (TESK) sufficient to treat 650 injured patients. In addition, provincial medical associations in Balkh and Nangarhar provinces have donated medicines and cash worth more than US $23,000 (AFN 1,750,000) towards the Herat earthquake response. Protection : As of 10 October, UNFPA through its partners (CARE, HealthNet TPO, AADA and MOVE) distributed 884 dignity kits, 907 blankets and 792 tarpaulins, and provided psychosocial support to 584 affected women and girls in 14 locations in Zindajan district. Sensitization on menstrual hygiene was also provided to 690 people in Mahal Baba Haji School (now closed), Herat Regional Hospital and GTC in Herat City. On the same day, UNICEF and War Child-UK provided MHPSS support at the GTC which is hosting 1,043 people (693 women, 138 girls, and 212 boys). Some 125 (56 girls and 69 boys) also participated in activities in two child-friendly space that had been installed at the centre. More than 130 women received psychological first aid (PFA) and 200 children (98 girls and 102 boys) received refreshments. UNICEF and War Child-UK also conducted a session on child protection for 50 women at the GTC. The Afghanistan Women Skills Development Centre (AWSDC), a local partner in Zindajan district deployed ten (five female) social workers for case management, eight (seven female) psychosocial support counsellors, and five (two female) community workers to assess and raise awareness on child protection issues in two villages. The Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Technical Working Group (MHPSS TWG) is using the ACF toll-free helpline 753 which is operational for eight hours a day to provide PFA. Through community-based protection approaches, community outreach volunteers created awareness of services provided by UNHCR and complaints and feedback reporting lines to affected persons in Asiabadak (two villages), Kachkal and Sia Ab in Zindajan district. In addition, DRC assessed 109 individuals in Herat City, mostly women-headed households and children displaced from the locations affected by the earthquake. DRC provided multi-purpose cash assistance (MPCA) to 84 of these but 25 of them moved to another location. Among some of those assisted on 10 October, 54 also received PSS services from the DRC protection team. Family reunification and support with the identification of family members in the affected villages were also provided. Family reunification efforts continue to be critical as families do not have access to communication and do not know where the injured individuals were taken. WASH : IOM distributed 30,000 litres of water through trucking to Sia Ab, Mahal Wardakah / Kernil and Kachkal villages in Zindajan district; fifteen handwashing stations were also installed in Asiabadak (5), Kachkal (4), Koshkak (2 villages) and Mahal Wardakah / Kernil (4). Some 127 hygiene kits were distributed to 60 households in Asiabadak (53) in Kachkal (7), while at the GTC, temporary/communal shelters and 128 hygiene kits were distributed to 118 families from Nayeb Rafi and Koshkak villages. Two blocks of latrines were installed at the GTC reception centre. UNICEF also provided nearly 9,500 individuals with water through trucking in Aghzalak (700), Bultan (700), Chema Ghoor (250), Ghar Moshak (420), Kachkal (175), Koshkak (770), Mahal Wardakah / Kernil (560), Nawabad (70), Nayeb Rafi (1,960), Sanjgab (1,085), Sar Balan (350) and Sia Aab (2,450) villages.

          "fullText": "HIGHLIGHTS 12,538 people, including 7,274 children, gained access to safe drinking water through construction and rehabilitation of water supply systems in the Centre-Nord, Sahel, Boucle du Mouhoun and Est regions. 3,236,666 children aged 6 to 59 months received Vitamin A supplementation. 9,488 new severely wasted children, including 1,211 were treated at community level with simplified approaches. Thanks to UNICEF funding in the Centre-Nord region, 60 health staff were trained on the management of severe wasted children with medical complications The country has recorded high cases of dengue fever, especially in the Hauts Bassins region around mid-August 2023. To respond to this, UNICEF has supported communication to the public on the prevention measures of dengue fever. For example, 907 health workers have been oriented on the revised dengue fever guidelines in the eight districts of Haut Bassins and the transportation of samples and medical regulations. SITUATION OVERVIEW AND HUMANITARIAN NEEDS. The security context remains highly volatile throughout the country with a notable escalation in the frequency and intensity of armed conflict activities between government forces (FDS/VDP) on one side and armed group factions on the other. The ongoing deterioration in the security situation is having a devastating impact on the local population, mainly in rural areas, resulting in heavy human casualties and waves of civilian displacements towards central localities. Since the last reporting period, the trend of armed attacks against FDS and civilians has increased not only in frequency but also in scale. The humanitarian situation is exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, negatively affecting children’s rights and welfare, thus increasing their vulnerability. As of 31 May, 2,062,534 internally displaced persons (IDPs) were registered, however an update of this data is currently being validated by the relevant authorities. UNICEF continues to deliver its programmes in various locations despite the volatile security context. Since the beginning of the year, the health situation in areas affected by the humanitarian crisis has deteriorated further, with an increase in the number of health facilities closed (375) resulting in 3,398,560 people without healthcare as of the end of July 2023. The reduction in healthcare services at all levels of the health pyramid remains a major concern, especially in landlocked areas where referrals and medical evacuations have become increasingly difficult due to insecurity. Persistent displacement of populations continues to cause family separation of several children. The number of hard-to-reach areas has more than doubled over the past year, which has significantly delayed the implementation of some WASH construction works for IDPs and host communities. The country's hydrological context also poses additional difficulties, with negative boreholes being recorded more frequently, making access to water more challenging.",

          "fullText": "The results of a randomized trial indicate a universal decolonization strategy could cut infection-related hospitalization in nursing home residents. The , published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that nursing homes that used a bathing routine to decolonize the skin and nasal passages of nursing home residents saw a significant reduction in infection-related hospitalization and all-cause hospitalization compared with nursing homes that didn't implement the strategy. The decolonization strategy also reduced the prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The study authors say the strategy, which has been adopted in many hospitals to reduce bacterial infections in intensive care unit (ICU) and other at-risk patients, could help protect a population that is highly vulnerable to infections because of age and illness. Roughly three million healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including urinary tract and bloodstream infections, occur in nursing homes every year, resulting in 150,000 hospital admissions and 350,000 deaths annually. MDRO prevalence in nursing homes is four times higher than in hospitals. Nimalie Stone, MD, MS, a senior advisor for long-term care with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion and a technical advisory panel member for the trial, says the strategy is important not just for preventing drug-resistant infections in nursing home residents, but could also help protect them from the physical and emotional toll that hospitalization can take. 'Nursing homes are a critical part of our healthcare system,' Stone told CIDRAP News. 'I think it's incredibly exciting to have an infection prevention intervention that is actually making residents safer.' Routine antiseptic bathing and nasal swabs. The strategy was tested in the cluster-randomized Protect Trial, conducted in 28 nursing homes in California by a team led by researchers from Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the University of California Irvine School of Medicine. The 14 homes that were randomized to the decolonization group adopted a bathing and showering routine with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) soap. They also swabbed residents' nasal passages with nasal iodophor antiseptic twice daily for 5 days a week, every other week. The 14 nursing homes in the control group followed their standard bathing routines. To evaluate the effectiveness of the decolonization strategy, trial investigators compared hospitalization due to infection during an 18-month baseline period (September 2015 to February 2017) and an 18-month intervention period (July 2017 to December 2018). The secondary outcome was all-cause transfer to hospital. They also looked at the prevalence of MDRO carriage among residents during the two periods. A total of 28,956 nursing home residents were involved in the study—15,004 during baseline and 13,952 during the intervention period. The characteristics of the residents in the control and decolonization nursing homes were similar. In the decolonization nursing homes, the mean compliance with the CHG bathing routine and nasal iodophor application was 87% and 67%, respectively, during the intervention period. During the baseline period, the proportion of hospital transfers due to infection was 62.2% in the control nursing homes and 62.9% in the decolonization nursing homes. During the intervention period, the percentage of hospital transfers due to infection fell to 52.2% in the decolonization nursing homes (risk ratio [RR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 0.88), while remaining roughly the same (62.6%) in the control nursing homes [RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.04] The relative risk reduction in the decolonization nursing homes versus controls was 16.6%. I think it's incredibly exciting to have an infection prevention intervention that is actually making residents safer. Results were similar with regards to all-cause hospitalization. In the decolonization group, the proportion of all-cause hospitalization fell from 35.5% in the baseline period to 32.4% during the intervention (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96). In the control group, all-cause hospitalization rose from 36.6% during baseline to 39.2% during the intervention (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.12). The relative risk reduction versus controls was 14.6%. A microbiologic analysis of swab samples collected from residents of 24 nursing homes in the trial found that MDRO colonization prevalence fell from 48.9% in the decolonization group to 32% by the end of the intervention, while MDRO prevalence in control nursing homes fell only slightly (48.3% to 47.2%). The prevalence of any MDRO significantly declined in decolonization versus control nursing homes (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.84), with reductions in MRSA (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (RR, 0.29; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.62), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing bacteria (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.75). Stone said the 30% reduction in MDRO colonization is significant because of the high prevalence of MDROs found in nursing homes in this study and others—as high as 55% to 60% in some studies. Previous research has shown that colonization with resistant organisms like MRSA can increase the risk of infection. 'That's a pretty big impact, given the level of exposure [to MDROs] in this population,' she said. The number needed to treat in order to prevent one infection-related hospitalization and one all-cause hospitalization was 10 and 12 residents, respectively. The researchers estimate that the decolonization strategy, if applied to all residents in a 100-bed nursing home, could prevent two infection-related hospitalizations per month. 'Compared with other healthcare strategies, this is a relatively simple win for nursing homes, and we hope nursing homes will want to adopt it,' senior investigator, Susan Huang, MD, MPH, of the University of California Irvine School of Medicine, said in a press release from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. Transmission networks. But the findings could have impacts beyond nursing homes as well, according to Stone. That's because nursing homes are now commonly serving as a 'bridge' for patients coming from hospitals and long-term acute care facilities (LTACs), where they've had to exposure to antibiotics, in-dwelling devices (such as catheters), and other risk factors for MDRO colonization and infection. The constant movement of patients between these facilities creates networks of transmission that can increase the risk of drug-resistant infections in all of them. 'People move in and out of these different healthcare settings constantly, and those pathogens go with them,' she said. The strategy of decolonizing patients with CHG and a nasal antiseptic has been shown in other trials to reduce MDRO colonization and infection in intensive care unit (ICU), non-ICU patients with devices, and MRSA carriers follow hospital discharge. Stone says that if regional networks of nursing homes, acute care hospitals, and LTACs all used the decolonization strategy, you could see benefits in each of those environments. 'Decolonizing individuals across healthcare can really benefit the entire community,' she said.",

          "fullText": "Pennsylvania-based Venatorx Pharmaceuticals announced yesterday that it has received a $167 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop a novel oral antibiotic for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). The BARDA award will support development of ceftibuten-ledaborbactam etzadroxil, which combines a cephalosporin antibiotic with a novel, broad-spectrum boronic acid beta-lactamase inhibitor. Venatorx says the combination may offer a new oral treatment option for outpatient therapy to treat cUTIs and other serious bacterial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales. An estimated 2.8 million cUTI cases are diagnosed annually in the United States, and cUTIs caused by drug-resistant bacteria are on the rise. 'Currently, there are no approved oral antibiotics that are effective in the treatment of drug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections to help address increasing drug-resistant bacterial infections globally,' Venatorx President and CEO Christopher Burns, PhD, said in a company press release . 'We believe that oral ceftibuten-ledaborbactam etzadroxil could play an important role in treating drug-resistant gram-negative infections, preventing unnecessary hospitalizations, and saving lives.' Ceftibuten-ledaborbactam etzadroxil has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product and Fast Track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has recently completed phase 1 clinical studies. The drug will advance directly to phase 3 trials under the BARDA contract. NDA approved for ceftobiprole. In other antibiotic-development news, Swiss biopharmaceutical company Basilea Pharmaceutica announced last week that the FDA has approved its New Drug Application (NDA) for ceftobiprole. The company is seeking approval for treating patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and community acquired bacterial pneumonia. 'We are pleased with the FDA's acceptance of our New Drug Application, which is another important step towards bringing ceftobiprole to patients with severe bacterial infections in the US, as there is a high medical need for new antibiotic treatment options, especially in complicated SAB,' Basilea Chief Medical Officer Marc Engelhardt, MD, said in a",

This data is available on . Explore the incidents in this Since violence seriously escalated in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories on 07 October, Insecurity Insight has identified at least 46 incidents of violence against or obstruction of access to health care. The incidents reported are not a complete nor a representative list of all events that affected the provision of health care and have not been independently verified. Numbers may change if or when further information is made available. Join our mailing for the latest information or visit our map. “In 2022, we documented the highest number of attacks on health care in a decade with more than 1,900 attacks reported. These have continued into 2023 with high numbers reported in and Ukraine . The assaults on health care in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories mark the latest episode in this wider pattern. Their horrific consequences for patients and health workers will not only be immediate but will reverberate into the long-term at a time when access to health care could not be more crucial,” commented Insecurity Insight Director, Christina Wille. In Israel where three incidents were reported, a hospital was hit with rocket fire, a paramedic was shot and killed and an Indian nurse severely injured during attacks carried out by Hamas militants. In the oPt where 43 incidents were recorded, at least 10 incidents reported hospitals, including a Ministry of Health Building, eye hospital, and children’s department being extensively damaged, 16 health workers killed and 20 injured by explosive weapons used by Israeli forces. Gaza’s 13 hospitals and other health facilities are only partially functioning due to shortages of medical supplies and fuel to operate backup electricity generators. The siege imposed by Israel on Gaza and cuts to electricity severely hamper the continuation of medical treatments. Israeli airstrikes on the Rafah border crossing, the only exit and entry point not controlled by Israel, further undermine the ability of medical supplies to be transported into Gaza. In the West Bank, health providers face challenges in reaching casualties and preventing their transfer to and from the city of Nablus following the Israeli forces closure of all entrances and exits to the city. Health care in the oPt had already suffered severe levels of violence prior to the latest hostilities. Insecurity Insight documented 171 reported attacks on health care in the oPt in 2022 for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition , mainly involving injuries to health staff while they were providing care during protests or as a result of violence from Israeli security forces and settlers. Ambulances were repeatedly blocked at checkpoints and hospital entrances were obstructed. The factsheet is available in and Some hospitals affected in the oPt had already suffered attacks in recent years. In one incident on 09 October, the children’s section of Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital in Gaza, was damaged by Israeli forces shelling, causing parts of the ceiling to collapse and fall. During the 11-day military operation in Gaza in May 2021, Israeli forces’ bombardment damaged roads leading to the hospital, hindering the ability of ambulances to access the area. Aerial bombing by Israeli forces during this period impacted hospitals, clinics, and health workers at least 53 times. Insecurity Insight calls upon all conflict parties to uphold international humanitarian law. Health workers and facilities are protected. Perpetrators must be held accountable. NOTES TO EDITORS.

          "fullText": "Pakistan’s government has declared that all unregistered Afghan refugees must leave the country by November 1 or face deportation, raising concerns for over 200 Afghan journalists in exile and amplifying the challenges they face in the wake of the Taliban's crackdown on press freedom. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and its affiliates, the Afghan Independent Journalists’ Union (AIJU), Afghanistan National Journalists’ Union (ANJU), and the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), strongly urge Pakistan’s government to reconsider the directive and call on media stakeholders, civil society organisations, and international governments to increase their support for Afghan journalists in exile. At a press conference on October 3, caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti ordered the exodus of all undocumented immigrants and refugees in Pakistan by November 1, threatening to use either provincial or federal law enforcement agencies to ensure the deportation of those failing to abide by the order. The announcement was met with appeals from the United Nations (UN) and the International Organisation for Migration, outlining the grave risks facing those compelled to return to Afghanistan amid the country’s ongoing ‘severe humanitarian crisis’. At least 200 Afghan journalists are currently refugees in Pakistan, forced to flee the Taliban’s crackdown on press freedom, including draconian restrictions on women journalists, shuttering of media houses, and rampant censorship. Many face barriers to visa renewal, employment, and basic food and shelter, relying on family, declining personal resources, or temporary support from non-government organisations while awaiting relocation to third countries. Since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, over 1,600,000 Afghans have sought refuge in the neighbouring nations of Pakistan, Iran, and Tajikistan, with over 70 per cent being women and children. The latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimate that over 3,700,000 Afghans currently reside in Pakistan, with only 1,330,000 registered as refugees. Pakistan is not a signatory to the UNRefugee Convention and lacks a national asylum system. The UN’s contractee for refugee registration, the Society for Human Rights and Prisoners' Aid (SHARP) has been criticised for its protracted administrative processes, leaving many in Pakistan without a way to attain protection or the required documentation. The visas of many refugees who initially held regular entry permits have now expired. In response to the new order, the Federation of Afghanistan Journalists in Exile (FAJE), a newly formed organisation advocating for journalists in Afghanistan and the diaspora, called on the United Nations, Pakistani authorities, and international organisations to increase support measures for Afghan journalists in exile, cease the arrests and abuse in custody by law enforcement, and raised concerns over the wellbeing of journalists and trade unionists deported to Afghanistan. Recent months have seen multiple arrest and deportation efforts targeting Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The most recent crackdown resulted in the arrest and detention of more than 250 undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants in Sindh Province, with Taliban officials claiming over 1,000 Afghans had been arrested over the past two weeks. Pakistan has claimed the deportations will address safety and security concerns, which they allege have been partially caused by Afghan refugees. In August, the IFJ and the PFUJ established two solidarity centres in Islamabad to aid Afghan journalists, supported by UNESCO. These centres provide emergency housing, legal and psychological support, and basic needs, with one centre exclusively for women journalists. The AIJU said: “With the change of the system and the existence of bad unemployment and great economic problems, including the closure of the media, a large number of our media employees left Afghanistan and became refugees in different countries; between 250 and 300 journalists have applied for asylum in different countries. Currently, they live in uncertainty with their families. Their relatives live in the cities of Pakistan. Our expectation from the authorities of our friendly and neighbouring country Pakistan is to create a safe environment for the temporary life of Afghan media workers to prevent them from being harassed or deported.” The ANJU said, “ANJU strongly condemns the forced eviction of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, particularly Afghan journalists and media workers who have already faced immense challenges in their pursuit of reporting the truth. We call upon the Pakistani government to reconsider this decision and continue to provide a safe haven for Afghan journalists and media professionals who have sought refuge within its borders. Furthermore, we urge the United Nations and international organisations to step in and support Afghan refugees, with a particular focus on safeguarding the rights and security of Afghan journalists and media workers during this critical time.' The PFUJ said: “PFUJ has urged the Government of Pakistan to revisit its decision about Afghan citizens. Peaceful and legally living Afghans should be allowed to continue their stay in Pakistan on humanitarian grounds.” The IFJ said: “While the IFJ acknowledges Pakistan's historic support for Afghan refugees, including many of the nation’s journalists and media workers who have fought to maintain a free and informed society, now is the time to extend and amplify these measures to ensure the safety, dignity, and rights of all Afghans in exile. Journalists who are forced to return to Afghanistan may face arrests, detentions, or worse upon their return, and the Pakistani government must immediately reconsider its imminent expulsion order that will have a dire impact on all in the growing Afghan diaspora. International governments and civil society organisations must also provide additional support, increase humanitarian intakes, and expedite immigration processes to allow for Afghan refugees in Pakistan to resettle swiftly and safely.” For further information contact IFJ Asia - Pacific on ifj@ifj-asia.org. The IFJ represents more than 600,000 journalists in 140 countries. Twitter:",

Cité Soleil in Port-au-Prince will remain in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) due to a deficit in food consumption and livelihood deterioration. The start of the spring agricultural season was disrupted by the extended dry period followed by near-average rainfall, contributing to a drop in yields. Harvests are ending, however, in Center, South Coast, North-West, and North-East, where the rains arrive later, corn, beans, and rice harvest have started. Since March, the HTG has appreciated 11 percent against the USD. Despite this appreciation and the price declines, prices of basic food products remain atypically higher than the previous year (more than 50 percent for most) and the five-year average (more than 100 percent). An increase in acts of violence and kidnappings has been observed since June in Port-au-Prince, North-West, and Artibonite. The situation remains vulnerable, especially in Croix-des-Bouquets, Bon Repos, Tabarre, and Carrefour Feuille, where armed individuals attack civilian populations. This unrest continues to impact the normal functioning of markets and lead to population displacements. In Central America, abnormally high prices and a delay in primera harvests will exacerbate the lean season. The poorest households located in the Dry Corridor of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, highlands, and Alta Verapaz in Guatemala, which have less capacity to respond to previous shocks, and face a lack of food stocks below average incomes, will face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) acute food insecurity outcomes until September, while the rest of the poor households urban and rural populations in the region will face Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. Starting in October, domestic harvests will lead to a seasonal drop in the prices of basic grains and an increase in labor opportunities until January 2024. However, some poor households applying Crisis coping strategies will persist in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). The rest of poor households will continue to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) acute food insecurity. Due to El Niño phenomenon, a decline in primera and postrera production for subsistence farmers is expected. The erratic and deficient rainfall, exacerbated by the atypical increase in temperatures, will continue to affect the crops of small farmers who have limited resources. These conditions will result in a decrease in their food stocks, forcing them to rely on the market earlier than usual, with food prices higher than the five-year average. Starting in October, high labor demand will improve the purchasing power of poor urban and rural households. Activities related to commerce and tourism are expected to be close to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since 2020. Irrigated agricultural activities will have average labor demand, except coffee, which will decline due to unfavorable weather conditions, resulting in a drop in income for daily laborers who depend on the volume harvested. In Venezuela, the informal dollarization of its economy continues to mitigate worse levels of acute food insecurity. However, high food prices and other basic needs continue to restrict adequate food consumption for poor households, who face Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. The poorest households whose only source of income is in already depreciated local currency (VED) will continue experiencing gaps in their food consumption or applying coping strategies to cover their food needs, especially in cases where access to Social Protection Program benefits and international remittances is infrequent. These populations, which are usually concentrated in peri-urban areas of Distrito Capital and the states bordering Colombia, are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Seasonal improvements due to double salaries (Oct-Jan) and the availability of food from local crops at the end of the year will benefit the population, decreasing the number of households in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). As in the rest of the region, below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures will negatively affect soil moisture for crop development. Although large and medium-sized producers are expected to be able to cope with their irrigation systems, it is likely that small farmers will see reduced crop yields. Rice crops will be more affected. However, since most of Venezuela's food supply is imported, the impacts on acute food insecurity will be focalized. In July, the monthly cost of the basic diet and the diversified diet, in VED and in USD, remained stable with respect to the previous five months. However, the cost of both diets is still about 400 percent higher in VED than it was in July 2022; meanwhile, the cost in USD remained stable. During the remainder of 2023, food prices in VED are projected to be above 2022 and the five-year average. Local currency depreciation, inflation, and exchange rate fluctuations could affect VED price movements.",

          "fullText": "UNOPS and UN Women will launch a campaign to call for action to empower women in rural areas. To mark International Rural Women’s Day, UNOPS and UN Women will launch a campaign to call for action to empower women in rural areas so they are better equipped to contribute to food security and climate change adaptation in their communities. From 9 October to 15 October (International Rural Women’s Day), UNOPS and UN Women across Africa will be sharing messages on social media and hosting events in different African cities such as Harare (Zimbabwe), Freetown (Sierra Leone), Tigray (Ethiopia), Kinshasa (DRC) and Juba (South Sudan), among others. The joint campaign aims to promote the role rural women play in supporting their households in achieving food security, generating income, improving rural livelihoods, and building climate change resilience. In Tigray, Ethiopia, UNOPS will be hosting a community discussion in Tigray, where stakeholders ―including women from the rural area, a government representative from Woreda and journalists ― will highlight the importance of addressing persistent gender gaps in the response to climate change and food insecurity. In addition, the discussion will also target how the existing projects have ensured the objectives are addressed in the project outputs. Addis Ababa, 08 October 2023― In Ethiopia, UNOPS is marking International Rural Women’s Day by launching the campaign to underline the contribution of rural women to development in Africa and highlight the importance of investing in gender-sensitive infrastructure that will allow women to have equal access to infrastructure as well as benefit from public expenditure. Moreover, women to have an increased role in decision-making processes in local development prioritization for an effective and sustainable contribution to food security and climate adaptation. The objective of the campaign is to call on micro and macro-level policymakers and decision-makers, members of societies, and international partners to action to support gender-responsive infrastructure in Africa that can empower rural women to access productive resources and opportunities, accelerate their socio-economic participation, and boost gender contribution to climate adaptation and food security. The campaign will include joint activities in several African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, among others. These events will be supported by a social media campaign in UNOPS and UN Women regional and national channels in Africa. On 13 October, UN Women Africa and UNOPS Africa will be hosting a live conversation, where stakeholders ―including a woman from an African rural area and a specialized journalist― will highlight the importance of addressing persistent gender gaps in the response to climate change and food insecurity. UNOPS Director a.i. for Africa Region, Dalila Gonçalves, said: “ Gender-blind infrastructure limits women’s access to financial resources, land, education, health, and other rights and opportunities. Also, it limits their capacity for coping with and adapting to climate change impacts. Women can play an active role as change-makers and educators in embedding sustainability within different infrastructure sectors. Supporting the empowerment of rural women through gender-responsive infrastructure, UNOPS helps low and middle-income countries across Africa in their journey toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. N Women Regional Director for East and Southern Africa and Regional Director a.i for West and Central Africa, Maxime Houinato, said: “Rural African women's pivotal role in bolstering regional economies and combating poverty is irrefutable. Yet, they grapple with pronounced challenges in securing vital agricultural resources, restricting their agricultural productivity and impacting their adaptability to climate change. UN Women studies reveal that gender disparities in agriculture have a direct impact on the economic growth of countries ranging from 13 to 28 per cent of GDP, equivalent to annually elevating 80,000 to 238,000 individuals above the poverty line per country. It's imperative that we advance programmes and policies that increase financing for rural women’s access to labour and time-saving equipment and services, fostering gender equality and improving rural women’s economic security.' According to UN Women , women make up more than 50 percent of Africa’s population and 80 percent of them reside in rural areas. The International Labour Organization states that giving women the same opportunities as men could raise agricultural production by 2.5 to 4 percent in the poorest regions and reduce the number of malnourished people by 12 to 17 percent. The UNOPS Report, ‘ Infrastructure for gender equality and the empowerment of women ’, stated that in rural areas inadequate infrastructure services disproportionately affect women’s time use because they bear the burden of household tasks, like collecting water and firewood, cooking, cleaning, and providing childcare. This limits the time available for pursuing educational, economic, or social activities. Women also face disadvantages when it comes to land and livestock ownership or equal pay which hamper their productivity and growth, resulting in weak rural economies, and impacting the local and global food systems and climate adaptation capacity.

          "fullText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. The study brought together technical experts in gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment and a monitoring and evaluation team to collect and explore a range of data gathered from populations affected by humanitarian crises and response actors in the DRC. In total 322 women and 270 men (85 women and 44 men aged between 18 and 24, and 237 women and 226 men aged 25 and over) responded to a humanitarian assistance appreciation survey, 80 men and 122 women took part in focus groups, 15 women and 16 men told their individual stories, 16 women and 34 men were interviewed as key informants, and 61 women's organizations took part in consultative workshops. Secondary and primary data indicate an improvement in the integration of gender needs analysis, vulnerability factors and sex and age disaggregated data into humanitarian needs analysis. Several commitments to the implementation of inclusive assistance, cross-cutting protection and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse have been achieved thanks to a better understanding of gender issues and the participation of women at community level in the humanitarian response. Despite this progress, the integration of gender equality and women's empowerment programming into coordination mechanisms remains deficient, notably due to the absence of requirements and responsibilities for actors in the terms of reference defining the functions of these mechanisms, and the persistence of barriers to the participation of women's organizations in coordination structures. The survey of affected communities shows that humanitarian organizations are doing a better job of responding to gender-specific needs, and establishing a process of dialogue with communities before delivering goods and services that respect the principles of dignity and respect. However, shortcomings persist in terms of monitoring the quality and targeting of assistance, particularly in the management of feedback and complaints submitted through feedback mechanisms. As part of a continuum, the current crisis continues to have an impact on gender dynamics, without calling current norms into question. While some sometimes subtle changes have been noted, there is little evidence of significant, lasting change. On the one hand, women's workloads are amplified by the need to earn income while performing most unpaid work for the well-being of the household. However, as women's contribution to household income increases, so does joint decision-making within the household. The participation of women's organizations in humanitarian response coordination mechanisms is widespread but remains more passive than active. Participating organizations appreciate the sharing of information, the opportunity to create synergies with other organizations and to enrich advocacy for the rights of women and girls. Notwithstanding the above, several barriers persist, notably of a practical nature such as the use of new communication technologies, and due to a culture, that privileges the role and contributions of large international organizations to the detriment of local organizations. The recommendations made in this document are the result of an analysis of three interrelated and interdependent issues. The first is to explore the integration of gender equality into understandings of needs and programming in line with the normative framework, using secondary data, interviews with key informants from UN agencies and the assessment of assistance by populations receiving goods and services. Secondly, the aim is to provide information on the various implications of the humanitarian crisis for women and men, and on gender dynamics. It is about discovering the different needs, priorities, capacities, contributions and coping strategies of women, men, boys and girls during a humanitarian crisis. Finally, women's and/or women-led organizations were consulted to examine their level of participation, as well as the barriers to their involvement in coordination mechanisms and, more generally, in the humanitarian response.

          "fullText": "KEY MESSAGES. ● El Niño conditions are currently present and are forecast to continue through at least early next year. In East Africa, El Niño impacts vary geographically. Across western parts, El Niños are associated with below-normal rains from June to September. Meanwhile, across the Horn of Africa, El Niños are associated with above-normal rains and flooding between October and December. A positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is also underway and will likely enhance above-average rains in the Horn of Africa. ● In areas recently affected by drought, increased rainfall will likely help to support drought recovery, increasing agricultural production and driving an overall decline in food insecurity. However, in floodprone and riverine areas, there is a substantial risk of flooding, which could destroy critical infrastructure and assets, cause crop damage and livestock deaths, displace populations, limit humanitarian access, and lead to localized increases in food insecurity. ● Across certain western parts of the region, dry spells observed between June and September, along with conflicts and socioeconomic challenges limiting access to inputs, could reduce agricultural production and exacerbate already very high levels of food and nutrition insecurity. ● Forecast flooding will likely drive additional population displacements in a region with already about 18 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, water-borne diseases, protection and gender-based violence (GBV) risks, and other humanitarian challenges. Persons with disabilities are disproportionately at risk of losing access to life-saving services. ● Floods are likely to reduce access and cause damage to existing water sources and sanitation infrastructures. The combination of damaged infrastructures, contaminated water sources, and population displacements may cause surges in malnutrition. ● Flooding and intense rainfall may cause water- and vector-borne disease outbreaks, as well as damage to or closures of health facilities. This in turn may reduce regular health service delivery and restrict access to healthcare. Likely population displacements and related overcrowding in locations hosting IDPs may further increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. ● Most countries already have in place policies, institutions, contingency plans and other initiatives for risk mitigation, preparedness, and emergency response for climate hazards. However, it is critical to urgently revise and/or implement existing tools while ensuring that preparedness, anticipation, and response efforts are informed by climate forecast updates and take into account the increased risks faced by certain vulnerable populations, such as women, girls, and persons with disabilities.",

Maize is the main source of calories and protein in the Guatemalan diet. White maize is more heavily consumed than yellow maize, but the latter is preferred in some regions and used as poultry feed. Every Guatemalan household consumes black beans: as a protein source it is a particularly valuable complement to cereals in regions where households have limited access to animal products. Consumption habits are strongly linked to tradition and culture. Rice is mainly consumed in urban and peri-urban, but some rural households consume it as well. Guatemala is highly dependent on imported rice. The market in Guatemala City is the largest in the country and feeds the highest concentration of the population.",

          "fullText": "International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts were today granted access to the rooftop of reactor unit 2 of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and did not observe any mines or explosives there, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said. From the top of the building, the IAEA team could also observe the entire rooftop of its turbine hall as well as parts of the rooftops of the reactor buildings and turbine halls of units 1 and 3, also without seeing any mines or explosives, Director General Grossi said. The team will continue making its long-standing request to also visit the rooftops of reactor units 1, 5 and 6 to monitor compliance with the five concrete principles for protecting Europe’s largest nuclear power plant (NPP) during the military conflict in Ukraine, which state that it should neither be attacked nor be used as a base for heavy weapons. Today’s development comes after IAEA experts on 3 August were allowed access to the rooftops of units 3 and 4, following reports that explosives may have been placed there. Also at that time, they did not observe any mines or explosives. “After repeated requests in recent months, we were at last able to go to one more reactor rooftop. While this is a step in the right direction, we still need more access to assess adherence to the five principles, which were presented and gained support at the United Nations Security Council. We will continue to insist until this is granted,” Director General Grossi said. The IAEA experts also require access to all six turbine halls to be able to confirm the absence of any materials and equipment that may contravene the five principles. This request has not yet been approved and the IAEA team can only confirm the status of one turbine hall at a time. Highlighting the risks facing the plant during the military conflict, the IAEA team at the site has continued to hear explosions almost every day. Usually, they appear to occur some distance away from the plant, but yesterday four blasts took place closer to the site. “Without any doubt, the nuclear safety and security situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant remains highly precarious. We will continue to do everything we can do help prevent a nuclear accident during the war in Ukraine,” Director General Grossi said. Of the ZNPP’s six reactors, five remain in cold shutdown, while unit 4 continues to be in a state of hot shutdown to generate steam to heat water for the nearby town of Enerhodar where most plant staff live and to process liquid radioactive waste. As previously reported, Ukraine’s national regulator, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), has issued regulatory orders to limit the operation of all six units of the ZNPP to a cold shutdown state. In addition, the IAEA has been strongly encouraging the ZNPP to find an alternative source of steam generation to cover the plant’s needs and allow for all the reactors to be maintained in a cold shutdown state. The ZNPP is continuing to conduct maintenance activities on unit 6 following its transition to cold shutdown earlier this month. The IAEA experts were informed that the site performed testing on two of the unit’s steam generators due to the presence of boron in the secondary circuit, which is an indicator of a leak, albeit much smaller than that found in one of the steam generators of Unit 4, which was subsequently repaired. In unit 6, the tests performed by the ZNPP identified small water leaks in one tube of each steam generator, which have now been repaired and testing is being performed to confirm the successful repair. The IAEA experts are also continuing to monitor the water situation at the plant following the destruction of the downstream Kakhovka dam in early June. To find alternative sources of cooling water for the reactors and spent fuel, the plant has recently completed the construction of 11 underground wells which are together supplying around 250 cubic metres per hour, which the site had estimated would be sufficient to maintain the level of all 12 sprinkler cooling ponds, which have remained steady following some issues with their levels in late September. Over the past week, the IAEA team has conducted walkdowns across the site, including within the site perimeter, in the main control room and reactor building of unit 5 and in the reactor building of unit 6. The experts have also observed testing of the safety system of unit 2 and maintenance activities on the transformer of unit 6. During these walkdowns, the team did not observe any new mines or explosives. As part of these activities, the IAEA experts also closely observe the performance of the operating staff as the team collects more information about the status of staffing and the training and licensing of staff at the plant. IAEA teams at Ukraine’s three other NPPs and the Chornobyl site report safe and secure operations of these nuclear facilities despite the continuation of the armed conflict. The IAEA team based at the Rivne NPP said it had completed scheduled maintenance of unit 2, including the successful loading of a new type of fuel into this reactor. After it was re-started, the reactor was today reconnected to the grid. Over the past week, the IAEA completed its 27th and 28th deliveries of equipment and other items designed to enhance nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, providing two Starlink terminals with associated equipment to the Khmelnytskyy NPP to support reliable communications to and from the site as well as a mobile helium leak detector with accessories for tightness control to the South Ukraine NPP. The equipment was procured with funds provided by the European Union, including the European Commission.",

          "fullText": "FAO Director-General addresses first Vatican Roundtable of African Farmers. Rome - The Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), QU Dongyu, today called for immediate action to help Africa get back on track to meet global goals on food security and nutrition, pointing to science, technology and innovation, investments, and the continent's reservoir of resourceful youth, as potential solutions. Qu was invited to address the first Vatican Roundtable of African Farmers, an event designed to provided farmers from Sub-Saharan Africa with the opportunity “to bring their unique perspectives and concrete experiences to the forefront of global discussions on agricultural development in their region,” organizers said. African policy makers, UN leaders, development organizations, international financial institutions, private sector, academia, and civil society were also invited. Farmers from Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe presented concrete cases of agricultural innovation and technologies and advanced key policy recommendations. The meeting took place just days before the opening of the World Food Forum . FAO's flagship annual event is designed to foster dialogue and debate among relevant stakeholders, ranging from the young and the youthful, farmers, small-scale producers, Indigenous Peoples, policymakers, agri-investors and scientists, all with one goal: moving the needle for food security to achieve better production, better nutrition, better environment and better life, leaving no-one behind. Africa has been a strong focus of FAO's efforts since its foundation, nearly 60 years. Unfortunately, the number of undernourished people there has risen to over 281 million since the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic, while conflicts and the climate crisis continue to plague the continent. Just this year, Cyclone Freddy struck Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and there are ongoing droughts in Uganda and Somalia. And while Sudan, Mali, Niger and others continue to be gripped by conflict, new data released only two weeks ago confirmed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be one of the world’s largest food crises, with one-quarter of the population more than 25 million people - facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity. This all means that Africa is not on track to meet the global goals on food security and nutrition set out in the    , nor the goals of the Malabo Declaration agreed to by Members of the African Union. 'In Africa, we critically and urgently need more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable agrifood systems to increase agricultural productivity to be 2 times higher than what it is now,' Qu said. Potential solutions. In his address to the gathering, the FAO Director-General focused on possible solutions, and 'how we can move quickly to implement them.' Science, innovation and technology, for instance, offer significant opportunities for economic growth and the creation of new jobs in agrifood systems by contributing to producing more with less; by reducing food loss and waste, by helping food production adapt and mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis, and by improving access to finance and market information. But only if their advances are accessible to everyone. Secondly, creating real change and at the scale requires investments, not just for agricultural businesses, but also for agricultural research, training for farmers, mechanization, as well as the introduction of new technologies and new crop varieties, and sustainable production systems. In this context, FAO engages with the private sector through flagship initiatives such as the Hand-in-Hand Initiative , which is designed to accelerate agricultural transformation and sustainable rural development and currently includes 36 African countries. Finally, with the highest percentage of youth in the world, more should be done to empower the continent's youth, whose agility, creativity and ability to innovate can be a game-changer in the efforts to overcome poverty and hunger in the region,' Qu said. This is the reason why youth engagement is one of the three pillars of the World Food Forum, which the Director-General created in 2021. Today’s roundtable was held at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, in Vatican City, and was sponsored by Bayer AG, with the patronage of the Pontifical Academy for Life.

          "fullText": "By Lilianne Nyatcha et Carine Tope. Ces dernières semaines, la Force de la MONUSCO en collaboration avec les Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo a lancé et intensifié les offensives contre les groupes armés réfractaires au processus de paix en Ituri. Pendant deux semaines, la MONUSCO et son partenaire FARDC ont lancé l’opération Spider web en territoire de Djugu afin de protéger les civils contre d’éventuelles attaques armées. Ces opérations ont produit des résultats , a affirmé vendredi 6 octobre à Goma le porte-parole militaire de la Force, le lieutenant-colonel Kevin Byabato du contingent tanzanien, lors d’une interview accordée à Radio Okapi, la radio onusienne. Cette offensive a permis de neutraliser huit combattants CODECO et de prendre d’assaut leur camp. Le lieutenant-colonel Kevin Byabato a rappelé que les combattants CODECO utilisaient la chaîne de montagne de Mbau comme forteresse, et qu’à partir de cet emplacement, ils lançaient des attaques contre les positions et les points de contrôle des FARDC : Ils utilisent des femmes et des enfants comme bouclier humain, ce qui est considéré comme un crime de guerre par la convention de Genève , a-t-il fustigé devant les journalistes. Ces opérations auront été salvatrices pour la population. Depuis le 5 octobre 2023, des mouvements de retour des populations déplacées par les combats ont été signalés. Rappelons que l’opération Spider web avait pour but de contrecarrer toutes les actions de l’ennemi et permettre aux populations civiles de reprendre une vie normale. Sa planification ainsi que son exécution ont été couronnées de succès et ont démontré l’importance de la coopération entre la MONUSCO et les FARDC dans le but de protéger les civils et de créer un environnement protecteur en territoire de Djugu , a indiqué, pour sa part, le major Hassan Kheira du bureau du porte-parole militaire de la Force. Ces offensives minutieusement planifiées ont été conduites dans les zones de Djugu centre, Pimbo et Masikini dans le secteur de Djatsi. Après la phase préparatoire avec le déploiement de la logistique et des troupes, les actions décisives ont débuté le 29 septembre et se sont concentrées sur la localité de Masikini. C’est à partir de cette position que les miliciens ont régulièrement mené des attaques le long de la route nationale 27. En septembre dernier, les FARDC y avaient neutralisé quatre miliciens CODECO. Des miliciens déroutés. Les soldats de la paix et les FARDC ont détruit le camp de la CODECO de Masikini, contraignant ainsi les miliciens à se replier dans la brousse, en direction du village Likopi dans le groupement Budhu, dans le secteur de Walendu Djatsi. Comme du côté de la MONUSCO, le lieutenant Jules Ngongo, porte-parole des FARDC en Ituri, se réjouit lui aussi de ces offensives conjointes entre les deux forces partenaires : Elles entrent dans le cadre de la mutualisation des forces sur le plan tactique et opérationnel, afin de protéger les populations congolaises contre toutes velléités des groupes armés qui sont encore hostiles au processus de paix. L’officier militaire congolais rappelle qu’il est indispensable de mettre hors d’état de nuire les milices qui ne veulent pas adhérer au processus de paix initié par les autorités et pour lequel certains traînent les pieds. Il regrette cependant que les miliciens semblent avoir pris le goût de s’attaquer aux paisibles populations, aux sites de déplacés, de tendre des embuscades et de mener des opérations de survie sur le dos de la population. Le chef des opérations du secteur Nord de la sécurité de la MONUSCO, le lieutenant-colonel Saifur Rahma, souligne que ces offensives impliquent trois contingents de la MONUSCO et permettent de faire passer un message aux groupes armés : Ils ne peuvent plus opérer comme s’ils étaient en terrain conquis, et sans risque pour leur vie. Implication de la population. Si l’opération Spider web a produit des résultats, c’est aussi grâce à l’implication, au soutien et à la collaboration des communautés locales. Le lieutenant-colonel Saifur Rahma salue cet élan patriotique. Le chef du secteur Walendu Djatsi, Justin Gudza, a personnellement participé à la sensibilisation sur le terrain pour encourager le retour des familles dans leur milieu d’origine. En outre, l’autorité locale a lancé un SOS pour une assistance humanitaire en faveur de certaines personnes déplacées qui n’ont plus de moyens de survie. Son vu le plus cher : le retour définitif de la paix dans son secteur et sur l’ensemble de la province de l’Ituri.",

While the sub-region continues to face many complex challenges in an equally complex and difficult global economic and geopolitical context, strong and determined voices, full of energy and hope, are being heard despite the deafening din of “bad news” reported almost daily by the media. These are the voices of young West African women and men who are committing themselves with enthusiasm and responsibility to help build a better future for their countries and the entire sub-region. Aware of the nature of the challenges and the usefulness of their involvement, young women and men are now key players in economic and political development. They already play a leading role, and want to continue to do so in resolving all the major issues facing the societies and governments of the countries in the sub-region. This is indeed the meaning of our commitment to young women and men, through the implementation, in partnership with ECOWAS, of Resolutions 2250 (2015), 2419 (2018) and 2535 (2020) on youth, peace and security. The 3rd Annual West Africa and Sahel Youth Forum, organized last July in Mindelo, São Vicente Island, in partnership with ECOWAS and the government of the Republic of Cabo Verde on the theme: “Empowering young women and men through quality education, decent work and innovative solutions to make conflict prevention more effective in maintaining peace and security in the region,” and the Mindelo Call to Action that crowned the Forum’s three days of work, testify to the growing role of young people and the need to include their vision in the treatment of subjects linked in particular to Peace and Security. The holding in Accra last August of the annual meeting of the Women, Youth, Peace and Securitý Working Group in West Africa and the Sahel, a coordination mechanism for the implementation of Resolutions 1325 (2000) and 2250 (2015), organized in collaboration with our partners, UN Women and ECOWAS, illustrates our ongoing commitment to supporting an inclusive, multi-actor platform where women and youth act for conflict prevention and peacebuilding in West Africa and the Sahel. As UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has pointed out, young people have become a driving force for societal change through social mobilization - pushing for climate action, seeking racial justice, promoting gender equality and demanding dignity for all.",

From 2009 until early 2019, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe implemented a multicurrency system. All price data were reported in USD. During the first half of 2019, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe transitioned away from a multicurrency system and all prices were collected and reported in ZWL. Between 2019 and March 2020, ZWL depreciated rapidly and contributed to high inflation. In March 2020 the government attempted to fixed the exchange rate at 25 ZWL to USD. By June 2020, authorities introduced a foreign exchange auction system and allowed the use of the USD again for domestic transactions. While some formal businesses and SMEs are benefiting from the auction system, the demand for USD remains elevated, fueling parallel market exchange rates. Today, prices are reported in ZWL in formal shops (such as supermarkets) and often in USD on open markets.",

WV Iraq continues to build the capacity of its staff, including in areas such as fundraising and management of human resources in humanitarian responses. WV Iraq also worked to identify and map all potential emergencies in Iraq, including but not limited to displacement flows, floods, earthquakes and droughts. Based on this mapping, in 2023, WV Iraq will continue to identify a complete catalogue of all identified needs and items for each response type and select qualified suppliers with whom we will have standby agreements in place to mount a rapid response.

          "fullText": "Amman, Jordan, October 11, 2023 The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is horrified by the mounting civilian toll and the destruction of residences and public infrastructure as violence continues across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The IRC strongly supports the UN Secretary General’s call for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to be upheld; to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure at all costs; to allow full and unrestricted access to aid for civilians in Gaza; and to mobilize the international community to provide immediate humanitarian support for those that need it. Over 1,200 civilians in Israel have been killed by rocket attacks in residential areas and acts of violence in civilian communities. There are reports of at least one hundred hostages taken. At least 900 civilians have been killed in the oPt and thousands more injured as airstrikes destroy schools, health facilities, and residential areas in the highly populated Gaza strip. Over 260,000 people reportedly have been displaced within Gaza since the current escalation of violence began. Public infrastructure has also been destroyed, meaning thousands of people will soon be left without food, electricity, water and fuel.Even before this crisis, 80% of Gaza was in need of humanitarian aid and 95% of the population did not have access to safe water. It is critical that all parties uphold IHL which demands protecting civilians and the infrastructure they depend on to survive. Hospitals, electricity and water plants must not be targeted. Authorities must ensure the basic needs of civilians - including access to water, food, medicine - are met. We call for adherence to IHL in order to avoid further civilian harm and mitigate the humanitarian fallout. The IRC is assessing needs on the ground and our capacity to ensure critical, life-saving humanitarian relief reaches affected civilian populations. The IRC works across the MENA region to support those in need across every aspect of their lives in order to restore safety, health, education, economic wellbeing, and meaningful measures of self-resilience.

          "fullText": "Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to brief the Security Council as it takes up the latest report of the Secretary-General on the Verification Mission in Colombia. As always, I am honored to be joined by Minister of Foreign Affairs Álvaro Leyva, and once again I thank him and the Government of Colombia for their continued trust in the work of the Mission in support of peace. I also welcome today the participation of Rodrigo Botero in this meeting. He is a leading Colombian environmentalist and participant in current peace efforts, his work thus illustrates the important connections between conflict, peacebuilding and the environment. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Council, We meet amid approaching milestones in the peace process, ahead of the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Final Peace Agreement and as the halfway point nears in the 15-year timetable for its implementation. Those who have deeply studied Colombia’s armed conflict point to skewed land distribution and the failure to enact needed rural reforms as one of its root causes. It is for this very reason that the parties to the Agreement placed comprehensive rural reform at its heart, making it the first chapter in the accord and the area requiring the most substantial long-term investments. It is not surprising, therefore, that lagging progress in this area in the initial years of implementation has limited the extent to which the Agreement has been able to bring the expected transformations to long marginalized rural and conflict-affected areas. Nevertheless, while a great distance still remains to attain the ambitious goals of the Agreement in this respect, I wanted to begin my briefing today with an acknowledgement of the increasing governmental efforts underway to bring about these reforms. I would say that a commitment to this particular section of the Agreement, in addition to the new peace dialogue initiatives, were the outstanding features of the recently concluded first year of the Petro administration as it sought to further consolidate peace in the country. Important policy actions in this regard are highlighted in the Secretary-General’s latest report, which recalls a year marked by substantial budget allocations for rural reform and its prioritization in the National Development Plan, increased dialogue with peasants and landholder organizations, and recent steps such as the establishment of the National Agrarian Reform system and the designation of four priority regions for comprehensive interventions in rural development. The commitment is brought to life in human terms in scenes such as that witnessed this past weekend in the town of San Juan de Arama, in the southern Department of Meta, where land purchased by the Government was delivered to some 500 beneficiaries, among them former FARC-EP combatants, peasants and indigenous members of the communities where they have resettled. Hopeful moments such as these are an increasingly common occurrence today, as Colombia’s Government takes up with greater dynamism this crucial, overdue aspect of the Peace Agreement. The most recent report of the Secretary-General also contains multiple examples that illustrate the interdependence between the implementation of the 2016 Final Peace Agreement and other efforts by the Government of President Petro to consolidate peace. A few weeks ago, I visited the former Territorial Area for Training and Reintegration of Carrizal, in Antioquia department, where more than 50 former FARC-EP members and their families live alongside members of the local community. There, as in similar locations around the countryside, one can see the admirable persistence of former combatants and communities joining efforts to improve their lives and realize the transformations foreseen in the Final Peace Agreement. In a project supported by the Mission, women former combatants who work in artisanal mines have augmented their incomes and that of the community by crafting and selling jewelry. Former combatants and community members have also joined forces in planting trees to counter deforestation. However, as I also heard in my conversations with ex-combatants and leaders of social organizations, these initiatives have been imperiled because of threats from illegal armed groups. In fact, this reintegration area is, like several others before it, likely to be relocated in the near future owing to insecurity. As the relocation is planned, I reiterate my call on authorities to ensure dignified living conditions in the new location and to continue to look after the safety and well-being of communities who remain behind. Allow me also to condemn, once more and in the strongest terms possible, the killings of former FARC-EP combatants, two since the report was issued. Nearly 400 former combatants have been killed since the signing of the Peace Agreement. This is simply unacceptable and calls for urgent and concrete measures from the authorities for their protection, as well as that of social leaders and human rights defenders. Mr. President, An important step in that direction is the recent adoption by the National Commission on Security Guarantees of the long overdue public policy to dismantle illegal armed groups and criminal organizations. This policy a product of consultations between the Government and civil society seeks to address the multiple causes favoring the creation and strengthening of criminal actors. Its implementation should help authorities to respond effectively to the ever-evolving threats in the territories. Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Council, The multiple expressions of violence that persist in several regions of Colombia should not continue to hinder implementation. The dialogue initiatives with armed actors promoted by the Government are undoubtedly a necessary additional effort to deactivate these threats and reverse their impact on communities by allowing the pending commitments of the Peace Agreement to materialize. This is particularly true for Indigenous and Afro-Colombian territories, in regions such as the Pacific, where the actions of armed groups and the limited implementation of the ethnic chapter of the Agreement keep communities under intolerable levels of violence and lack of opportunities. Mr. President, I would like to once again welcome progress at the negotiation table between the Government of Colombia and the National Liberation Army (ELN). In particular, I would like to highlight the development of the bilateral ceasefire, which has resulted in a de-escalation of the conflict between the parties. I also underscore the importance of the Council’s support in allowing the Mission to contribute to this process through its participation in the Monitoring and Verification Mechanism. This mechanism is contributing to the prevention and resolution of incidents between the parties. I am also pleased to report, thanks to the contributing countries, about the recent arrival to the country of 31 of the 68 international observers authorized by this Council and deployed specifically for the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire. The work of the National Participation Committee installed in August to promote the participation of all sectors of the Colombian society in the peace process with the ELN is also moving forward. Yesterday, the negotiation table met, for the first time, in Bogota, proof of how the process is taking root in Colombia. Mr. President, We view positively the dialogues between the Government and the group that identifies itself as Estado Mayor Central FARC-EP. The parties announced last weekend a suspension of offensive actions against each other, and their intention to establish peace talks along with the entry into force of a bilateral ceasefire as of 16 October. I have been informed that the parties will soon request this Council that the Mission can be authorized to participate in the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire. I will make sure that this Council all the information necessary to consider this request. The expectations generated by progress towards the construction of a peace process must be matched with the fulfillment of reached commitments, with the de-escalation of confrontations and, especially, with the respect for the rights of communities, social leaders and signatories of the 2016 Agreement. The constant demonstration of the will of the parties requires, necessarily, avoiding the repetition of events such as the attacks in Cauca department last month, which resulted in the tragic death of civilians from communities that have been seeking peace for decades. President, Distinguished Members, As we meet in the month of October, which marks the anniversary of resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, I salute the Government of Colombia and civil society organizations for their progress towards the finalization of the first national action plan for its implementation. In this same context, another key milestone is the recent decision of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP) to open Case 11, which will address gender-based, sexual and reproductive violence by the parties to the conflict. I acknowledge the leadership and tireless work of hundreds of civil society organizations across Colombia who advocated for the opening of the case. This important development adds up to recent progress by the SJP on its way to issuing the first restorative sentences, including recent acknowledgements of responsibility made by all parties. Contributing to the truth and acknowledging responsibility are an obligation of all parties to the conflict and constitute fundamental pillars for the success of this process. As the Secretary-General stated in his report, promptly reaching the stage in which the SJP issues its first restorative sentences is important for the peace process as a whole. Likewise, for restorative sentences to fulfill their objective and thus honour the principle of the centrality of victims, it will be definitive that the Government guarantees that conditions are in place for their prompt and effective implementation. To this end, the Mission continues to work closely with the SJP, individuals under its jurisdiction, as well as with Government and State entities. Mr. President, Members of the Council, From conducting a participatory process to develop the national action plan for Security Council resolution 1325 alongside women platforms, to consultations with peasants and landowners over rural reform, dialogue with grassroots organizations has been a prevalent practice of the current administration. I salute this inclusive approach, which provides opportunities for building consensus on public policy. In that spirit, I encourage the Government, former FARC-EP combatants and all actors invested in the comprehensive implementation of the Final Peace Agreement to prioritize constructive dialogue. This will be essential for sustained progress in areas such as the ethnic chapter, the rural reform, reintegration as well as illicit crop substitution. Also critical to moving forward is the definition, without further delay, of a clear institutional architecture to oversee implementation, including the appointment of the high-level official within the Presidency tasked to lead these efforts. The period ahead will be key for translating new plans and initiatives into actions. Mr. President and Distinguished Members, In over two weeks, Colombia will hold its second local elections since the Final Agreement. Unfortunately, violence has already impacted the electoral campaign in various regions, and has affected parties across the political spectrum, including former combatants and members of the Comunes party. I trust that authorities will do their utmost to guarantee that both candidates and voters can participate in the elections in the most inclusive and secure way possible throughout the national territory. This would deepen a tangible outcome of the Final Agreement. Mr. President, Colombia’s conflict was once considered intractable. The peacebuilding efforts underway today with the crucial support of this Council, came about following frustrated attempts in previous decades. But Colombians never gave up on peace, and nor did the international community. In times of tensions around the world, Colombia’s case is a reminder that even the most entrenched of conflicts can be resolved through dialogue, and a call to never desist in the search for peace. I thank you.",

          "fullText": "We are halfway to the deadline set by the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals , our best and only chance of leaving the world better than we found it. While decades of progress have lifted more than a billion people out of poverty, COVID-19 and a series of geopolitical shocks have resulted in serious setbacks. But there’s still time to finish strongif we course correct. SDG 1, eliminating poverty in all its forms, is the all-access key. This year, as we mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty , we look at what poverty tells us about the state of the world and what it means for human dignity, and with a focus on quality jobs. But first, let’s strip 'no poverty'the bedrock of all the SDGsdown to its basics. “What IS poverty in all its forms?” Poverty isn’t just lack of money. It’s a trap. It’s poor health, sub-standard or no education, and lack of political power. It’s dangerous it often comes with unsafe housing and perilous working conditions. It’s unfair. The poor aren’t treated equally under justice systems and their healthcare is inferior.    This relentless cycle condemns billions, through no fault of their own, and often just by accident of birth and place of living, to hopelessness and insecurity. But having a job is not a guarantee of being out of poverty. According to the International Labour Organization, 13 percent of the world’s workers are moderately poor and 8 percent are in extreme poverty. Simply put And poor people are often treated unfairly in justice systems. UNDP supports justice for all, particularly for those living in poverty and the disadvantaged, including women, children, minorities, people with disabilities and those living with HIV/AIDS. In 34 countries, 32 million people have now realized their legal rights and protections. How does poverty harm the human family? Poverty is a dragging anchor that holds entire countries back, and worse. It weakens the social fabric. History provides plenty of examples of how quickly unequal societies flail and fall, often violently. One of the great changes in mindsets of recent decades is that we have recognized that poverty is not ‘natural’ or an inevitable fact of life. It’s the very unnatural outcome of failing to truly recognize, or care, that every human is equal in dignity and deserves the same opportunities. It is a byproduct of unjust biased laws, policies or institutions that deepen marginalization. In more than 30 countries, women and girls do not have the rights to inherit or own land. The World Bank says about 90 percent of the land in sub-Sahara Africa is undocumented. With about 80 percent of poor people live in rural areas, land titling could have a significant impact on poverty levels and food security.    We built the systems that created poverty, which means we can also take them down.    What is the quickest way to do this? Spoiler alert: It’s not rocket science. We know what works and we have done for a while. One thing we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic is that economic priorities are not set in stone. During the global health emergency, resources were quickly re-deployed to support social protection programmes that kept families and businesses afloat. At least in the countries that could afford it. In the last three years alone, more than 190 countries rolled out more than 3,333 social protection measures, with 73 percent of low-income countries and 66 percent of lower-middle-income countries relying on social assistance measures, mainly cash transfers. UNDP advocates for a Universal Basic Income , which has the potential to restore dignity and create a cushion against future shocks.    “A new social contract needs to emerge from this crisis that rebalances deep inequalities that are prevalent across societies. To put it bluntly: The question should no longer be whether resources for effective social protection can be found but how they can be found.” Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director for Asia and the Pacific.    showed how even a temporary basic income given to hundreds of millions of women would have stemmed the tide of rising poverty and inequality, particularly for women, during the COVID-19 pandemic. What does UNDP do? Ending poverty is at the top of UNDP’s priorities, and we look at the big and small picture. UNDP has long recognized the multidimensional aspects of poverty. For decades we have dug into the data to understand where people are poor and why. Our Multidimensional Poverty Index Report regularly updates data from 110 developing countries, with the aim of improving the lives of 6.1 billion people. Poverty gaps between women and men are particularly acute between the ages of 25 and 34, as women struggle to combine paid work with an unequal burden of care for families. For every 100 men in this age group who are poor, there are 122 women. UNDP’s Gender Equality Strategy shows that since the COVID-19 pandemic, women have been nearly twice as likely to lose their jobs than men. Yet fewer than 20 percent of policy responses across the world have addressed women’s economic insecurity. We know that no country has achieved full gender parity and less than 1 percent of women and girls live in a country with high women’s empowerment.    “At a time when progress towards achieving gender equality is often stalling or even reversing, this ambitious new Gender Equality Strategy will guide UNDP in its efforts to assist countries to move beyond piecemeal efforts towards portfolio approaches that shift power structures and the economic, social, and political systems that perpetuate discrimination.” Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.    We also know that small interventions can have a big effect, which is why we work with small business owners all over the world on almost every kind of issue. Whether it's in the Himalayas, creating alternative energy grids in sub-Saharan Africa, or working on land rights issues in Colombia, we create conditions that ensure women have the skills, resources and infrastructure to create their own wealth and to build businesses that benefit not just themselves but their communities and their natural environment. What does a world with no poverty look like? Let’s find out!    “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” Albert Einstein.    The greatest human minds have always been able to rise above the stale status quo to achieve true transformation in the way we see ourselves and our world. And we are at one such point in history where change is imperative. The SDGs are our big idea. Achieving each requires a shift in attitudes and priorities. The entire UN family is doubling down on its commitment to bring all of them across the finish line by 2030.    “This is not a time for incrementalism, this is a time for transformation with all hands on deck. Let’s get the SDGs back on track.” António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General",

          "fullText": "Key Messages The recently concluded main season harvest is supporting Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes in northern surplus-producing areas of Zimbabwe, central and northern areas of Mozambique, Madagascar, and Malawi, and the northern province of DRC as households access food from their 2023 harvested stocks and income from crop sales. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are widespread in areas where poor household food stocks are gradually depleting, and households increasingly depend on market purchases where food prices remain largely higher than the five-year average. However, Crisis IPC (Phase 3) outcomes are present in parts of the region that recorded poor harvests following the impact of Tropical Cyclone Freddy and prolonged dry spells, particularly in southern Malawi, central and southern Mozambique, and parts of southern Zimbabwe, and conflict in eastern DRC. The return of IDPs in Cabo Delgado has improved accessibility by government and humanitarian organizations, driving Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes. Consumer price inflation in South Africa, Lesotho, and Mozambique continued its disinflationary trend in August as prices of staple commodities slowed. However, in Malawi, Angola, Madagascar, and the DRC, headline inflation has been increasing along with food inflation, which is expected to continue to negatively impact household purchasing power, particularly as market food purchases increase and food stocks decline. Fuel price inflation increased in August and will likely quicken in September after petrol and diesel prices increase. The recent increase in global oil prices will likely lead to higher agricultural input and transportation costs, with the region’s 2024 cereal crop planting seasons set to commence in October 2023. Following the conclusion of the 2023 harvest, poor households across Southern Africa are engaging in seasonal off-farm income-earning activities such as petty trade, casual labor and construction, producing and selling vegetables, firewood, and bricks, and artisanal mining to earn income. However, increased competition, poor liquidity among better-off households, and low demand for products and services are limiting poor household earnings. In the coming months, poor households are likely to increasingly engage in agricultural labor opportunities with the start of the 2023/24 agricultural southern-africa-kmu-2023-10 season. However, the ongoing strong El Niño will likely result in a delayed and erratic start to the rainy season, particularly in Zimbabwe, southern and central Mozambique, southern Malawi, and southern Madagascar. An erratic and delayed start will likely impact cropped areas and income-earning opportunities. Close monitoring of rainfall totals and distribution will be required to assess the severity of adverse impacts on cropping conditions for the 2023/24 harvest. Governments and donors should prepare now for rising food assistance needs in 2024. Based on historical trends during a strong El Niño, there is concern that acute malnutrition rates will likely rise across Southern Africa due to below-average harvests impacting household food availability and access, along with high staple food prices and limited income-earning opportunities for poor households. Lower-than-normal household purchasing power is also likely to impact household dietary diversity and food utilization negatively. In August 2023, UNICEF reported that 2023 severe acute malnutrition admission trends continue to be within the long-term average, with Zimbabwe and Angola recording slight declines in admission trends. However, during the 2016/17 El Niño, Zimbabwe recorded a 25 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition cases. Overall, a potential rise in acute malnutrition rates is likely to be exacerbated by inadequate access to treatment amid ongoing funding gaps.",

          "fullText": "Le vendredi 8 septembre 2023, à 23 heures, un puissant séisme d'une magnitude de 6,8 sur l'échelle de Richter a frappé les montagnes de l'Atlas, à environ 70 kilomètres au sud de Marrakech, au Maroc, causant la mort d'environ 2900 personnes. Cet événement sismique a eu des répercussions significatives sur l'environnement bâti de la région. Bien que les chiffres exacts restent à déterminer, les premières indications montrent que près de 50 % du patrimoine bâti de la région a subi des dommages de diverses gravités, allant de légers dégâts à un effondrement structurel complet. En conséquence, plus de 50 % de la population de la zone exposée (soit plus de 400 000 personnes) a été directement touchée, et de nombreuses autres sont indirectement affectées. Cela se traduit par des personnes dormant à l'extérieur par crainte des répliques, hébergeant et soutenant d'autres familles, ainsi que par les fermetures de routes, les modifications des cours d'eau, les impacts sur l'agriculture et d'autres moyens de subsistance, etc. Pour aggraver les difficultés, de nombreuses communautés touchées se trouvent dans des régions montagneuses reculées difficiles d'accès, où l'hiver, qui approche rapidement, peut être rigoureux et accentuer l'isolement. CONSTATATIONS GENERALES. Les méthodes de construction dans la zone touchée varient considérablement, comprenant un mélange de systèmes de construction traditionnels en pierre/argile et de construction moderne en béton armé et maçonnerie confinée dans les villes plus importantes et les villages facilement accessibles à proximité. Les premières investigations sur le terrain n'ont montré aucune différence significative dans les performances sismiques des systèmes de construction traditionnels ou modernes. Les deux formes se sont bien comportées lorsqu'elles étaient correctement construites et ont échoué en cas de construction médiocre. Dans de nombreuses régions, le mélange improvisé de systèmes traditionnels et modernes a été l'une des principales causes de défaillance. Comme dans d'autres catastrophes similaires, l'équipe de Miyamoto a constaté la tendance de certains à blâmer le matériau de construction dominant plutôt que la qualité de la construction. Une croyance courante dans de nombreuses communautés touchées par un séisme dans le monde entier est que les anciens systèmes de construction traditionnels doivent être 'mauvais et faibles', tandis que les nouvelles techniques modernes telles que l'acier et le béton sont intrinsèquement 'meilleures', que la construction en béton est plus durable que la terre et la pierre. En réalité, le nombre de structures en béton endommagées et/ou effondrées constitue une preuve flagrante que la mauvaise qualité de la construction est la principale cause de défaillance, et non la confrontation entre les matériaux modernes et traditionnels. Les montagnes du Haut Atlas et les vallées environnantes sont sujettes aux séismes depuis des millénaires. Les techniques de construction traditionnelles locales ont évolué pour résister aux séismes grâce à des décennies d'essais et d'erreurs, en utilisant des matériaux abondants disponibles localement. Cependant, les systèmes de construction vernaculaires traditionnels nécessitent une analyse structurelle spécifique. Lorsque certaines techniques, telles que l'utilisation de roches plates avec un bon enchevêtrement et des murs épais de 50 cm, des poutres de toit traversant les murs et des fondations en roche solide, sont utilisées, les structures deviennent pratiquement indestructibles, se comportant bien lors des séismes, comme en témoignent de nombreuses structures en pierre bien construites et non endommagées dans les villages éloignés proches de l'épicentre. Cependant, il était évident que de bonnes pratiques avaient été perdues ou oubliées dans de nombreux bâtiments au fil du temps depuis le dernier séisme significatif, qui remontait à plus de 100 ans. Avec un si long intervalle entre les événements sismiques, une perception décroissante du risque a incité de nombreux propriétaires et entrepreneurs à prendre des raccourcis pour accélérer la construction et réduire la main-d'uvre. L'équipe de terrain de Miyamoto a toutefois rencontré de nombreux maîtres maçons locaux qui comprenaient instinctivement les bonnes pratiques et pouvaient clairement expliquer les causes du succès et de l'échec des structures traditionnelles. La construction moderne observée dans la zone touchée consistait principalement en un système de maçonnerie confinée avec des blocs de béton ou de la pierre avec un remplissage de boue. Ce système est bien défini dans de nombreux pays et, lorsqu'il est correctement construit, résiste exceptionnellement bien aux charges sismiques. En revanche, lorsqu'il est mal construit, les résultats peuvent être catastrophiques. En plus de nécessiter une formation appropriée, un défi majeur pour de nombreuses communautés éloignées est que des matériaux tels que du ciment de haute qualité, des agrégats fissurés de taille appropriée et de l'acier d'armature de qualité peuvent être peu économiques et/ou difficiles à obtenir et à transporter. L'adoption de techniques de construction modernes varie considérablement dans la zone touchée, semblant généralement être directement liée à la proximité de la communauté et à l'accès aux marchés urbains. Beaucoup de communautés situées à quelques heures de route des centres urbains semblent fonctionner davantage comme des banlieues satellites que comme des communautés agricoles rurales, de nombreux habitants évoquant leurs déplacements pour le travail, l'éducation ou les soins de santé. L'adoption de techniques de construction modernes dans ces communautés n'est pas seulement inévitable, mais aussi sensée, car les besoins en maind'uvre locale en construction rivalisent avec des emplois urbains mieux rémunérés, et l'accès à des matériaux modernes rend les options moins intensives en main-d'uvre plus viables. Cependant, dans les communautés plus éloignées des montagnes du Haut Atlas, l'architecture autochtone unique de la région est intrinsèquement liée à l'histoire et à la culture des habitants. La préservation de l'architecture intrinsèquement résistante aux séismes de ces régions pourrait également stimuler l'industrie touristique vitale dans des zones où le changement climatique et la migration urbaine rendent les moyens de subsistance traditionnels moins viables. Il est essentiel de capitaliser sur les connaissances des maîtres maçons de la région et de partager ces connaissances avec la population plus large de la région dans le cadre des efforts de reconstruction.",

Particularly committed to the fight against diseases linked to unsafe water, the leading cause of death in the world, SI's interventions provide expertise in the field of access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene promotion, but also in the essential area of food security and livelihoods. Present in some twenty countries, the SI teams 2500 people in total, made up of expatriates, national staff, permanent staff at HQ, and a few volunteers - intervene with professionalism and commitment while respecting cultural norms. ABOUT THE MISSION. Following fighting between SAF (regular army) and RSF (rapid support forces) since April 2023, SI is developing a rapid emergency response in Sudan. In Geneina, West Darfur, SI opened a base in August 2022, providing assistance to IDPs living in the gathering sites inside the city. The response was WASH in emergency activities with water trucking, construction of boreholes, hygiene kits distribution, latrines construction and rehabilitation. Today, the situation in Darfur, and specifically in Geneina is worsening due to the conflict at country level. SI is assessing the sites and the needs for an emergency response which began in May 2023, providing WASH in emergency activities to the IDPs and host communities in Geneina, and possibly in other states in Darfur (El Fasher, Nyala). SI began water trucking activities in May 2023 and is the only WASH actor in Geneina. In the East of the country, especially Gedaref, Al Jazirah and Madani states, security situation is tense but much calmer than in Darfur. SI is doing assessments to implement a WASH/shelter and NFIs response for IDPs, mainly coming from Khartoum. In Khartoum, SI wants to develop a WASH emergency response as soon as possible, and when authorizations are provided. SI is one of the pillars of the INGO forum coordination, especially for Darfur.

          "fullText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. Streamlining monitoring and reporting of country achievements is a major regional strategic objective for WHO. Our first report, Progress on the health-related sustainable development goals and targets in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2020 documented progress prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and identified key challenges to achieve these targets. This second report, Progress on the health-related sustainable development goals and targets in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2023 presents an update on country and regional trends using data available for 50 health-related indicators (across nine out of 17 SDGs) from January 2010 to June 2023. The 2023 progress report includes enhancements in the reporting of the health-related indicators from the 2020 report. In response to calls for improved monitoring of inequality, the 2023 report presents disaggregated data for a portion of the indicators. Further efforts have been made to affirm data sources and improve quality control so that a more detailed and accurate picture of regional progress can be presented. Despite WHO and country efforts to improve the quality and availability of data, lack of trend and disaggregated data continues to hamper the monitoring of progress on health-related SDGs at national and regional levels. Data on the health-related SDGs were compiled from several sources using countries’ validated data. United Nations agencies’ standardizations or estimates, the WHO Global Health Observatory and the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Health Observatory were the key sources. Regional mean values were obtained from the primary data sources whenever available or calculated using population-weighted approaches if there were at least 10 countries with data available for that indicator. Progress on the health-related SDG targets at both the regional and country levels shows an anticipated slow-down with setbacks across many indicators on health coverage, health risks, determinants and health status compared to the 2020 report. The slower progress is reflective of the negative impact of the pandemic, economic issues and ongoing complex emergencies faced by half the countries in the Region. Progress on most of the health coverage indicators has been too slow to meet the 2030 targets, although modest improvements were observed on mean coverage of health services, proportion of the population facing financial hardship due to high out-of-pocket payments, and density of health-care personnel. Progress slowed or stalled on health risk factors. A high proportion of children under 5 continue to face malnutrition. Minimal improvements have been made on environmental risks like air pollution, water and sanitation. Unchanged unemployment rates and the high proportion of children not achieving minimum reading proficiency are examples of determinants of health with available data that paint a bleak picture. The minimal progress on health coverage, health risks and determinants explains in part the stalled progress on three quarters of the morbidity and mortality indicators including maternal and child mortality rates, mortality rates due to NCDs and prevalence of key communicable diseases. Nevertheless, at the country level, successes do exist: since 2010, the under-5 mortality rate in the Region has decreased from 60 deaths per 1000 live births to 45 deaths per 1000 live births, mortality from NCDs has dropped by more than 15% in Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and the UHC Index has increased by 10 or more points in Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran and Qatar. As the most intense pandemic response phase came to an end, the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 outbreak and the strengthened public health commitment have once again allowed a shift towards crucial public health priorities, health system strengthening, essential health-care services and the enhancement of national health information systems. Country successes demonstrate possibilities and provide inspiration to build the momentum to address priorities that may have slipped off the radar during the pandemic. Large inter-country differences exist both in the current status and in the progress being made towards the SDGs across most indicators. The unavailability of data for around one in five indicators a quarter of data reported is from 2019 or earlier hinders progress reporting. At the same time, lack of disaggregated data impedes efforts to promote health equity through gender- and equity-sensitive policies and programmes. This limited data disaggregation by age, sex, place of residence and other variables is a major barrier to generating information through a gender and equity lens to inform public health action and “leave no one behind”. Improving the availability of disaggregated data would allow us to monitor and guide relevant evidence-informed policy changes and implementation to address inequities. These perspectives demonstrate the need for more and stronger action for better results. Achieving the health-related SDGs requires bold action across four areas: (i) advancing universal health coverage by investing in quality, accessible and integrated health services over the life- course; (ii) adopting an all-hazards, whole-of- government approach to public health preparedness and response; (iii) addressing health risks and determinants by promoting comprehensive multisectoral coordination policies and mechanisms to adopt and implement; and (iv) expanding evidence-based and data and research-informed gender- and equity-sensitive policy-making. These measures are not new: they were spelled out in the 2020 report as well as in previous decisions of WHO governing bodies by the Member States and the Secretariat. Despite disrupting progress, the COVID-19 crisis has also presented an opportunity to propel the SDG agenda forward by underlining the necessity for stronger, more collaborative governance as well as demanding the exploration and use of novel approaches. Though current indicators may not reflect the anticipated progress, the pandemic has instilled resilience and enabled the mobilization of resources that can now be redirected to addressing other health-related matters contributing to the attainment of the SDGs. Together, it is possible to accelerate progress toward the health-related SDGs in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, for example through joint United Nations platforms such as the Regional Health Alliance, and to achieve health for all by all.",

          "fullText": "Geneva/Beirut/Benghazi, 11 October 2023 *---* One month after devastating floods struck Libya, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Libyan Red Crescent Society (LRCS) are urgently calling for support to meet immediate needs in clean water, sanitation, cash assistance, and crucially, psychosocial support. The floods have wreaked havoc, displaced thousands and straining already fragile infrastructures in regions such as Derna and Tobruk. The disaster led to overwhelming destruction, with people losing homes, family members, and their sense of security. Libyan Red Crescent Society teams were the first responders, providing vital services from search and rescue to first aid. To date, 450 dedicated volunteers have been actively involved in these efforts, some even losing their lives while saving others. Tamer Ramadan, IFRC Head of Delegation in Libya, said: 'The emotional and physical toll of this disaster has been immense. While we have been diligent in our immediate response, the recovery process is far from over. Attention must not wane.' In Libya, the focus of aid is not just immediate relief but also long-term recovery. Cultural norms favor financial autonomy; hence cash assistance is essential. Furthermore, with damaged sewerage systems contaminating water sources in Derna, there's a heightened risk to community health. Teams are also focusing on providing holistic psychosocial support, especially given the emotional toll of losing entire families. The LRCS has been indispensable in relief efforts. With a central emergency operation room in Benghazi and two temporary centers in Derna, their services range from family reunification to relief item distribution. They've supported over 54,000 people through various services to date. In light of the escalating needs, IFRC has officially launched an appeal for 10 million Swiss francs to support the ongoing efforts of LRCS in providing comprehensive aid and care for survivors. As of now, 3 million Swiss francs have been raised, leaving a crucial 70 percent of funding appeal yet to be met. Donations can be made through participating national societies and directly via the IFRC website. More information.

          "fullText": "Attachments (Dar-es-Salaam/Addis, 11th October 2023) The 2nd International Conference on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is underway in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, from October 9th to 11th, under the theme “Change in a Generation.” World Vision commends the African Union and the Government of the Republic of Tanzania for hosting this crucial event, which also coincides with the International Day of the Girl. The conference aims to assess progress made in eliminating FGM in Africa, where 160 million women and girls have undergone the practice that is prevalent in parts of West, East, Central, and Northern Africa. The urgency to end FGM has gained momentum, with international, regional, national and local organisations, including youth and child activists, calling for an immediate elimination of this harmful practice. “It's violence against children and no girl should go through FGM particularly because it violates their rights and takes away their childhood” reminisces Tenema, Sierra Leone. The United Nations and the African Union recognises FGM as a violation of girls’ rights and have endorsed initiatives like the AU Saleema Initiative and the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation to eliminate this harmful practice. Article 5 of the Maputo Protocol strongly condemns all forms of abuse against women and girls, emphasising legislative measures and sanctions to eradicate harmful practices.    “States Parties shall prohibit and condemn all forms of harmful practices which negatively affect the human rights of women and which are contrary to recognised international standards. States Parties shall take all necessary legislative and other measures to eliminate such practices, including: prohibition, through legislative measures backed by sanctions, of all forms of female genital mutilation, scarification, medicalisation and para-medicalisation of female genital mutilation and all other practices in order to eradicate them” Maputo protocol on Women’s Rights.    World Vision recognises the severe physical and psychological consequences of FGM on girls and women, including pain, infections, and complications during childbirth. FGM also deprives girls of their rights to education and bodily integrity. “It is easier to get transmitted diseases such as HIV during an act of cutting as they use the same razor blade or knife for all girls, I am grateful to my aunt who saved me from being married and circumcised” according to a girl from Simanjiro, Tanzania. Female Genital Mutilation persists due to gender inequality and entrenched cultural beliefs, often preceding child marriage. Despite being illegal in many countries, economic, social and cultural pressures force girls and young women into this practice. Turning the tide on child marriage and FGM requires a multi-sector approach to create lasting change, as such World vision through it’s Big Dream Project is working to address this. The approach follows the WHO’s evidence-based strategies for best practices in child protection work. The Big Dream changes social norms harmful to children, empowers parents and caregivers with knowledge and skills to enable them take daily sustainable actions for (i) protecting children from physical and sexual violence, child marriage, FGM, and other forms of violence against children, (ii) strengthens household economic conditions to reduce financial incentives for child marriage, (iii) promotes education and life skills training for girls. The three-pronged approach reinforces the role of the family and community leaders, sustainable family incomes and the importance of education. Progress has been made in recent years in the fight against FGM. The practice is declining fast among girls aged 15 to 19 in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Liberia and Togo among other countries, which is very commendable. Despite the large number of laws that ban FGM, prosecutions are rare, and there is limited information available on prosecutions or the outcomes of any prosecutions made in recent years. World Vision calls for ; Urgent action at the 2nd International FGM conference, emphasising the need for collective resolve and commitment from State Parties, aligning with the African Union Agenda 2063 aspiration of a people-driven Africa that safeguards women, youth, and children by ending all forms of gender-based violence, especially FGM. Accelerated efforts and investments in girls’ education in line with the African continental strategy for education; Enforcing existing legislation and policies banning FGM particularly, efforts to contain crossborder FGM; Support families with economic opportunities and implement social protection policies where they exist.

          "fullText": "SITUATION OVERVIEW. On Friday (6 October), Security Council members held their 17th annual joint consultative meeting with members of the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The meeting opened with a discussion on the situation in Sudan and regional ramifications of the crisis and called for peace and stability in the region. On 5 October, the Sudanese Foreign Minister rejected the draft resolution presented before the UN Human Rights Council’s (HRC) 54th session in Geneva to establish an independent investigation mechanism to investigate human rights violations in Sudan. The draft was said to lack objectivity and fairness. Minister of Finance and Economic Planning reportedly confirmed reaching an understanding with international funding institutions to support the funding of essential services in Sudan (education, health, water and other basic services). On 3 October, Lt. General al-Burhan met with representative of the National Mechanism to Support Democratic Civil Transition led by former Sovereignty Council member Aisha Musa. The mechanism’s vision is to restore a peaceful, civil and democratic path in Sudan in consultation with national stakeholders. The leader of the National Umma Party announced a three-day visit to the United Arab Emirates to discuss ending the wat and support for the Jeddah process. Meanwhile, Kenyan President, William Ruto met with IGAD Executive Secretary to discuss a coordinated approach in supporting the resolution of the conflict in Sudan. Heavy fighting and air strikes continue to be reported in Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri without any indication of a possible cessation of hostilities; heavy shelling was reported in the residential neighbourhood of Omdurman. Fighting has also reportedly extended to neighbouring areas to Aj Jazirah State. In Darfur, the Armed Signatory Movements (ASM) are seeking to increase presence and mobilize further personnel in effort to protect civilians and aid the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance. Increased RSF mobilization efforts are also being reported around El Genina, West Darfur, where the situation remains tense with a possible renewal of fighting. In South Darfur, fighting between the warring parties continued, a situation further exacerbated by on-going inter-communal tensions between the Beni Halba and Salamat communities and heavy rains and flooding. In Central Darfur sporadic fighting was reported around Zalingei and Hassahissa IDP camp which continues to be impacted by RSF artillery fire. In North Kordofan, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was reported in El Obeid and in its proximity. In response to the RSF’s claims over Wad Ashana last week, an increase of SAF deployments in Kosti and around the Rabak-Kosti bridge, White Nile were reported. In South Kordofan, clashes between SAF and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement North/Al Hilu (SPLMN/AH) also continued across various locations. IOM’s DTM also reported attacks by the RSF on the El Fakharin village in Abassiya locality in South Kordofan, which has led to the displacement of nearly 280 households, most of which are currently sheltering in villages within the same locality. DTM Sudan estimates that 4,551,795 individuals (907,833 households) have been recently internally displaced. The IDP caseload has been observed in 4,647 locations across all of Sudan’s 18 states. The highest proportions of IDPs have been observed in River Nile (12.66%), South Darfur (11.19%), East Darfur (11.01%), Aj Jazirah (8.07%), Northern (7.97%), and North Darfur (7.37%). Field teams report that the IDPs observed were originally displaced from 8 states. The majority (3,120,044 IDPs, 68.55%) have been reportedly displaced from Khartoum state; followed by South Darfur (14.58%), North Darfur (7.97%), Central Darfur (3.99%), West Darfur (3.75%), South Kordofan (0.72%), North Kordofan (0.43%), and Aj Jazirah (0.01%). DTM Sudan also estimates that approximately 2.63% of the IDP caseload are non-Sudanese nationals. In addition to the internal displacement, the conflict in Sudan has caused the mixed cross-border movements of 1,237,103 individuals into neighbouring countries namely Egypt, Libya, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia. 65% of arrivals tracked in those countries were Sudanese nationals and 35% estimated foreign nationals and returnees. The majority of arrivals were reported in Chad (40.5%), Egypt (26.1%), and South Sudan (24.6%). The recent statement published by the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Ms. Clementine Nkweta-Salami, highlights Sudan as the world’s fastest-growing displacement crisis. While outlining the complex and overlapping challenges faced by displaced and host populations, the statement highlighted the need for additional funding to continue the provision of critical assistance to affected populations.",

          "fullText": "One week after the release of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation Laudate Deum, faith leaders around the world are endorsing support for a Loss and Damage Fund to mitigate the detrimental and unjust impacts of climate change already affecting the poor. Many Global South nations contribute the least to the climate crisis, yet pay the heaviest price of other nations’ operations. At COP28 (November 30 December 12), faith leaders will deliver a statement calling on world leaders to protect the poor and work towards true climate justice. “Solidarity demands urgent action by those with means and responsibility. A Loss and Damage Fund that genuinely meets the needs of people at the frontlines of the climate emergency is not just a responsibility; it is an undeniable moral imperative,” says President of Caritas Internationalis Msgr. Archbishop Isao Kikuchi. Loss and Damage refers to the impacts of climate change that are already being experienced around the world, especially by people in the Global South. Following the global climate talks at COP27 in Egypt last year, a breakthrough decision was reached to establish a Loss and Damage Fund for communities suffering from the current climate emergency. Senior Vatican representatives, faith based groups from climate vulnerable countries and diverse stakeholders all contributed to the discussions held at COP27, and particularly reflected on the moral case for action on Loss and Damage. According to the UNHCR, more than 20 million people are forced to leave their homes due to extreme weather events including sea-level rise, prolonged droughts and severe flooding, and environmental degradation. Caritas Internationalis and SCIAF (Caritas Scotland), together with CIDSE and the Laudato Si’ Movement, believe that there is a deep disharmony at the heart of the climate crisis which is hurting our poorest brothers and sisters the most. “A Loss and Damage fund should not just be symbolic, but one that supports those who bear the brunt of the climate crisis. In the face of the escalating climate crisis, this commitment to fairness and accountability should serve as the cornerstone of efforts. Let us rally together in solidarity and purpose!” says Alistair Dutton, Secretary General of Caritas Internationalis. The final details of the Loss and Damage Fund will be agreed at COP28 in Dubai later this year, and faith leaders will deliver their statement in support of a fit-for-purpose fund to protect the poor which: gets money to the people who need it the most; is adequately resourced based on the polluter-pays principle; fully addresses non-economic losses and damages; and corrects the injustice of poorer nations paying the price of other nations’ actions. The urgency to act is growing every day and the price for our lifestyles is already being paid by those who have contributed the least to the climate disaster. “The Loss and Damage fund is simply a matter of justice and recognition of responsibility. What’s needed now is the courage to take the decisions and make the fund and mechanisms a reality,” says Josianne Gauthier, Secretary General of CIDSE. In light of the realities of the climate crisis, Tomás Insua, Executive Director of the Laudato Si’ Movement, calls for shared vision for the future based on justice and compassion: “Let us be the generation that rises above indifference, challenges the status quo, and paves the way for true solidarity with the Loss and Damage Fund.” Endorse the Loss and Damage Fund statement here:",

          "fullText": "Attachments Across Africa, most migration takes place within the continent, and this is particularly true for sub-Saharan Africa.7 In 2022, the migratory landscape in the East and Horn of Africa (EHoA) region remained largely fluid and complex in nature.8 While forced migration continued to drive the main movement trends within and across countries, the overall drivers of mobility have become more mixed and inextricably intertwined. By the end of the year, the region hosted a very large population of internally displaced persons (IDPs 9.6 million) and refugees and asylum-seekers (3.8 million) due to widespread conflict and violence, political persecution, human rights violations, climatic events and harsh environmental conditions.9. Most of the international migrant stock hosted in the region is constituted of refugees and asylum-seekers, with refugee movements primarily taking place within the region. As a result, the EHoA hosts a slightly higher number of female than male migrants, which is a unique characteristic compared to other parts of the continent and to global trends. Women and girls tend to represent the largest share of the refugee population, while men and boys tend to dominate labour migration dynamics. Well-established formal and informal labour migration corridors are present across the region, wherein labour demand in destination countries remains the key structural determinant of the mobility landscape. Saudi Arabia, together with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, continues to attract large volumes of migrants, mostly female domestic workers, including through formalized recruitment channels, whereas men are mainly engaged in agriculture and herding and move in an irregular manner. Meanwhile, South Africa continues to shape the migration aspirations of people in search of the “Southern Dream” through an established economic system with successful diasporas that act as both catalyser and safety net for the migrant population. While the full extent of the COVID-19 impact on international migration is still unclear, the EHoA is predicted to have more individuals emigrating from the region than individuals immigrating to the region in the coming years. International migration will continue to affect population growth, yet its contribution will not lead the growth process, which will still be driven by natural change (or the balance of births over deaths). One of the major events leading global headlines in 2022 was the longest and most severe drought critically affecting parts of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. Largely impacting agropastoral communities, the drought devastated their main sources of livelihood and strained their resilience to climate change. New and varied mobility patterns were adopted to cope with this climate shock, including split-household arrangements whereby some members of the same household stayed in the country of origin and some migrated, often at short distance. These new patterns also included involuntary immobility for those with depleted livelihood assets who were unable to move elsewhere. The large-scale impact of the drought was so profound that internal displacements (or flows) caused by disasters in the region more than doubled in the past year, moving from contributing to around 20 per cent of all displacements in 2021 to 50 per cent in 2022.10 By the end of 2022, 36.6 million people were affected by drought, 2.7 million were displaced and 5.7 million IDPs were living in affected areas.11. In parallel with climate events, conflict and violence also persisted in different parts of the region, mainly across Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan. The signing of the northern Ethiopia peace deal in early November 2022 has brought new hope for reduced tensions and unhindered humanitarian access to the conflict-affected regions of Tigray, Amhara and Afar.12 Despite this step towards peace and stability, tensions continued in other parts of Ethiopia while national and localized conflicts were widespread in Somalia and South Sudan, fuelling displacement and driving humanitarian needs through 2022. The volatility of the conflict environment in the region and in neighbouring countries characterizes the EHoA as a critical humanitarian context where compounding crises are making resources scarcer to meet the needs of the affected populations. In 2022, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in the region reached 43.8 million, a record high that represents 28 per cent of the corresponding regional population.13. Conflict and climate events, along with the macroeconomic challenges faced by the region, have not reduced the will to migrate. On the contrary, in 2022, a major shift characterized by the full resumption of mixed migration trends across key migratory routes in the region was observed, thus marking the end of the impact of COVID-19 on mobility. Significant flows resumed along the Eastern Route from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian Peninsula which also saw substantial forced and spontaneous returns, mostly to Ethiopia and Somalia. More importantly, data pointed to how climate shocks and persistent conflict and violence across the region are also affecting extraregional migration dynamics, as highlighted by the increase in these drivers across the Horn and upon arrival in Yemen. While still predominantly economic in nature due to widespread unemployment, land shortages and lack of opportunities at home, migration drivers along the Eastern Corridor became increasingly mixed and intertwined in 2022. Protection concerns were still high along this route, as well as along the Southern and Northern Corridors, given that migrants continued to use multiple smuggler networks with limited awareness of the risks that these perilous journeys entail, while often being deceived about their length and costs. Nonetheless, despite a misconception that most people in this region move irregularly, migration from Africa is largely regular and comparatively little migration from the continent is via irregular channels towards Europe or GCC and Middle Eastern countries.14. The A Region on the Move report series for the EHoA, which has been the regional flagship publication since 2017, aims to improve the regional migration evidence base for good migration governance in support of sustainable development and effective humanitarian action. Over the years, the report series has illustrated the main humanitarian situations, with a focus on internal displacement and mixed migration flows along the major migration corridors of this region. A Region on the Move 2022, the tenth report in the series, features limited updates from official data sources, such as estimates on international migrants, labour migration statistics and data on trafficking in persons, which were still being consolidated at the global and continental level at the time of writing this report. However, this edition provides new insights into population estimates, net migration, and return and reintegration, while expanding on the deaths and disappearances of people on the move. This report provides an advanced understanding of the main migrant groups and the environment in which mobility takes place; therefore, Chapter 1 opens with an overview of regional data and trends on international migrants and continues with a discussion of specific migrant groups including refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs and migrant workers as well as trends on international remittances. Given the predominant humanitarian nature of the EHoA migratory landscape, Chapter 2 delves deeper into the subject of internal displacement, which is largely driven by conflict, violence and climate shocks. Finally, Chapter 3 examines mixed movement trends along the main migration corridors in this region, which are generally irregular, with particular attention to migrants’ varying needs, profiles, challenges and vulnerabilities, including an analysis of assisted return trends and reintegration challenges. The report concludes with the Migration Outlook where the main drivers shaping future mobility trends are discussed to provide an indication of the most likely scenario for the region in the short and medium term.",

          "fullText": "Climate finance announced in today’s Budget “doesn’t go far enough” to meet Ireland’s UNFCCC obligations. Trócaire has welcomed the additional €60 million allocated in Official Development Assistance (ODA) in today’s Budget, but warned much higher increases are needed given the scale of humanitarian crises and for the Government to meet its commitment to spend 0.7% of Gross National Income on ODA by 2030. Trócaire CEO, Caoimhe de Barra, said: “Investment in global humanitarian and development needs is vital given intensifying crises globally. Protracted conflict and violence, political instability, economic crises, along with climate impacts, mean that overseas aid is more critical than ever for millions of people living in poverty globally, particularly women who bear the brunt of these crises.” Ms de Barra added that the climate finance announced in today’s Budget “doesn’t go far enough” to meet Ireland’s UNFCCC obligations. “It is the world’s most marginalised people who are suffering the most due to the failure of global political leadership to act with urgency on the climate crisis and also due to decades of broken promises on overseas aid and international climate finance,” Ms de Barra said. Ms de Barra called on the Government to urgently deliver on its commitment to provide €225 million per annum of international climate finance, at a minimum, with a view to rapidly increasing this allocation in the context of actual needs of developing countries and in line with Ireland’s fair share of climate finance. Latest figures show that €99.6 million was delivered in climate finance in 2021. Ms de Barra said: “Given the rapid pace of climate breakdown, there is a real need to ensure that climate finance is additional to overseas aid and that there is full transparency. Otherwise, there is a risk of simply re-labelling existing aid as climate finance, rather than allocating additional funds.” “We have seen the stark picture of climate breakdown this year, including the devastating drought in the Horn of Africa and Cyclone Freddy in Malawi. This requires additional commitments on loss and damage finance for Global South countries.” “Along with a new global goal for climate finance need in the near future, the existing climate finance commitment by Ireland will need to dramatically increase in coming years this is part of Ireland’s agreed obligation as a richer country that has disproportionately contributed to global excess emissions.”",

          "fullText": "The drying trend intensifies through October and November, reaching its peak in January of the year following an El Niño event. During this period, rainfall in the western Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) can be as much as 50-60 per cent below the average from January through April. Based on these predictions, it is anticipated that FSM will face severe drought conditions in the first quarter of 2024, especially El Niño is officially declared by the end of September 2023 [...] The Micronesia Red Cross Society (MRCS) is currently gathering data to assess the impact of this slow-onset disaster. However, the urgency to mobilize resources and stocks to meet future needs is evident. The trigger for requesting a Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) is the potential severity of the situation, including escalated drought and cyclone risks, the islands' vulnerability, and logistical challenges. Therefore, prompt readiness actions are crucial, focusing on resource mobilization and strategic planning to alleviate expected hardships. Once the country officially acknowledges the drought situation, upgrading the imminent IFRC-DREF to a full-response IFRC-DREF will be imperative to safeguard communities and ensure sustainability in these challenging times. Once MRCS receives more data to confirm the impact of this slow-onset disaster, it will start to mobilise resources and stocks to cater for future emerging needs. To fully respond to the effects of this drought, this will be confirmed once the effects are visible, and the country is declared in a drought situation where this imminent IFRC-DREF will then be upgraded to a full response IFRC-DREF.

This brief summarizes FEWS NET’s projection of the population in need of urgent food assistance and the severity of anticipated acute food insecurity in FEWS NET-monitored countries seven months into the future. The projected size of each country’s population experiencing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and higher) is compared to last year and the recent five-year average, categorized as Higher, Similar, or Lower. Additional information is provided for countries with large food insecure populations, an expectation of high severity, or where other key issues warrant further context. Analytical confidence is lower in FEWS NET’s remotely monitored countries, indicated by “RM.” Visit    for detailed country reports. FEWS NET defines the total PIN of urgent humanitarian food assistance as the combined number of people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity outcomes, regardless of whether they are receiving assistance, plus any populations in lower IPC Phases who would likely be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse in the absence of humanitarian food assistance. The IPC follows a different approach to estimate the PIN, which can be found here.",

          "fullText": "ABUJA, NIGERIA, 11 October - Every year on October 11, the world unites to celebrate the resilience, strength, and potential of girls, highlighting the distinct challenges they face worldwide. As we approach the midpoint of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) journey, the focus on the well-being and rights of all, especially girls, becomes even more critical. Despite the strides made, the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Report 2023 indicates a sobering 131 years before we achieve full gender parity. The current global landscape, marked by resistance to gender equality and multifaceted crises, has further jeopardized the rights of adolescent girls, putting the vision of a just world for all at risk. UNICEF Representative in Nigeria Ms. Cristian Munduate said, 'The potential of our girls is limitless, but we must first provide them with the platforms to express, learn, and thrive. Our commitment to this cause is unwavering and paramount for the nation's progress.'* She further added, *'In a rapidly evolving world, the dreams and aspirations of our adolescent girls are the beacons that can guide our efforts towards a more inclusive, equitable future.' In Nigeria, the stakes are high for an estimated 26 million adolescent girls (ages 10-19). To ensure Nigeria remains on course for the 2030 SDGs, the spotlight must shine brightest on its girls, especially those marginalized due to disability, poverty, or crises, and those who are pregnant, parenting, or married. Our collective responsibility extends to championing girls’ education, preventing harmful cultural practices, advancing menstrual hygiene, offering tailored health services, and meeting the nutritional requirements of these young ladies. While the terrain might be fraught with challenges, there's hope. Nigeria’s adolescent girls are not passive bystanders but active agents of change, driving transformative initiatives in their communities. The time has come for their voices to echo louder in the halls of decision-making. Girls from UNICEF’s programme in Katsina and Sokoto, for instance, have put forth actionable demandsranging from life skills training and accessible digital devices to the critical involvement of fathers in girls' education. On this International Day of the Girl, UNICEF Nigeria calls for renewed vigor in safeguarding and fostering the rights of adolescent girls. Their boundless potential deserves nothing less than the country’s utmost commitment and investment. Media contacts. Safiya Akau. Communication Officer. UNICEF Nigeria. Tel: +234 706 418 4023.

Conflict & Climate Change. “The combination of conflict and climate change is driving hunger and the international community needs to respond. Humanitarian need is currently outpacing available resources at an alarming rate.” Mr Regan said the additional allocation for climate finance was timely and essential. “When you look at the impact which climate change is having on communities in recent years, from the droughts in the Horn of Africa, to the floods in Pakistan or the rising sea level in Bangladesh, you see the urgency and scale of the response that is needed,” he said.

They have not been considered enough to have a voice in matters that affect them, and the services and support they deserve are often far worse in quality, including health and recovery approaches. The World Health Organization (WHO)’s QualityRights (QR) initiative has developed a comprehensive package to build capacity among mental health practitioners, people with psychosocial, intellectual and cognitive disabilities, people using mental health services, families, care partners and other supporters, nongovernmental organisations, organisations of persons with disabilities and others on how to implement a human rights and recovery approach in the area of mental health in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other international human rights standards. CBM Global Nepal has taken the initiative organising four days of training of trainers (ToT) on Quality Rights for the relevant professionals such as Project Partner staff, Academia, members of the Organization of People with Disabilities (OPD), members of National Human Rights Commission, policy makers of Government Health System, Mental Health professionals, Disability Advocates, etc. involved either in services and or movements linked to psychosocial disability in Nepal. The training will help to develop a pool of professionals, who can later on, either provide training to the service providers and project staff on QualityRights in Nepal, may contribute to national or local level policy implementation, raise awareness among cross OPDs on the rights of the people with psychosocial disabilities involved in the project areas and beyond, and reinforce person centered human rights-based recovery approach throughout the health and other Government systems. CBM Global is looking for a consultant to: 1. Facilitate four days face to face QualityRights ToT in English and/or Nepali in Kathmandu, Nepal. 2. To submit a final report on the change in knowledge and attitudes of the training participants following the training. 3. Develop training materials, tools, and handouts used in the training.

The event was designed to amplify the rights and potential of Somali girls, emphasizing their importance and the need to empower them. The high-level event convened over 200 participants in Mogadishu, including government leaders, UN representatives, youth activists, civil society groups, community elders, journalists, and development partners. In opening remarks, Deputy Minister Abdihakim Jimale Aden reiterated the government’s strong commitment to tackling persistent human rights issues like child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM) and lack of educational access that continue to severely impact Somali girls. “We must proactively create an environment where every girl has a fair chance to learn, grow and achieve her dreams free from discrimination and harm,” he emphasized. In his remarks at the occasion, UNFPA Somalia Representative Niyi Ojuolape called for increased multi-sectoral collaboration and investment to break long-standing cycles of gender inequality. Reiterating the community-wide and positive national impact of empowering the girl child, Ojuolape stated that “an empowered girl lifts her entire community, but can only do so by having access to health services, education and related opportunities. It is not only the morally right thing to do but also a pragmatic economic decision that aids national development,” he added. The event also marked the official launch of an innovative new project aimed at improving women and girls’ access to quality maternal and newborn healthcare across Somalia. The $2.7 million “Healthier Somali Women and Girls” project, funded by USAID and implemented by UNFPA, will strengthen maternal and child health services in marginalized communities of Southern and Central regions of Somalia. “With targeted investments and interventions, we can make a real difference in the lives of Somali women, newborns and infants.”emphasized USAID Mission Director Sheri-Nouane Duncan-Jones in her remarks. Further, UNICEF Somalia Representative Wafaa Abdelatef, in her statement at the event, noted that “We cannot make progress without listening directly to girls themselves, to understand their lived realities, hopes and ideas for positive change,” while urging for a more participatory approach in addressing the well-being of women and girls. A highlight of the event was an inter-generational panel discussion between young women and activists, government officials, UN representatives and civil society members focused on strategies to expand girls’ rights and opportunities in Somalia. Youth advocates shared personal stories of helping prevent child marriage and female genital mutilation in their communities, highlighting the importance of support networks. Broadly, the panelists spoke on the need for effective mentorships to end harmful practices and veritable platforms that allow young people to lend their voices to the advocacy. With rousing cultural performances, and urgent calls to action, the event succeeded in spotlighting the need to dramatically scale up targeted investments in the health, education, protection, and empowerment of Somali girls to unlock their enormous potential and catalyze national progress.",

          "fullText": "Attachments On Tuesday, October 10, 2023, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) held its first public hearing session on the case on the Application of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , brought by Canada and the Netherlands as State Parties to the Convention, against the Syrian regime (formally named the Canada and the Netherlands v. Syrian Arab Republic). At the request of the two countries, the session focused on imposing what are known as provisional measures on the Syrian regime to compel it to immediately cease torture against potential victims, while the trial of the Syrian regime for the alleged violation of the Convention Against Torture proceeds. According to the court session’s transcript , the case draws upon a number of UN sources, as well as on data provided by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), which was cited as a source 14 times, while the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (COI) was cited 24 times. In her oral argument, Annemarieke Künzli, Legal Counsel to the Kingdom of the Netherlands’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs, indicated that the Netherlands and Canada have made joint efforts to move forward with good-faith attempts at negotiations with the Syrian regime, which are well-documented through the exchange of 66 Notes Verbales over the course of three years, as well as through two in-person meetings held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in April and October 2022. All of these efforts have been fruitless, however, Ms. Künzli lamented. On the imperative need to impose provisional measures, Teresa Crockett, the Canada’s Deputy Director of the Accountability, Human Rights, and United Nations Law Division of Global Affairs Canada, stressed that there is no doubt that the Syrian regime’s continued and repeated violations of the Convention Against Torture “are causing irreparable prejudice to the rights at issue”. Such conditions, she underlined, require urgent intervention from the ICJ. Furthermore, Ms. Crockett pointed out that during the three-month delay period granted to the Syrian regime at its request, SNHR has documented no fewer than 15 cases of death due to torture at the hands of the Syrian regime. She also referenced SNHR’s extensive report which addresses the charges that were met with the capital punishment: “[Those accusations have] been leveled in a widespread and indiscriminate manner by the regime’s security agencies against thousands of detainees and forcibly disappeared persons . . . with no grounds except for interrogation records containing ‘confessions’ extracted under the duress of torture.” Relatedly, Ms. Crockett noted that SNHR has collected details of the Syrian regime’s “public prosecution’s reliance on confessions extracted under torture, and has confirmation of dozens of detainees having been forced to appear in grotesque ‘confession videos’, which are also broadcast on official State media.” At the conclusion of the argument, Alan H. Kessel, the Assistant Deputy Minster and Legal Advisor to Global Affairs Canada, outlined the objectives of the seven provisional measures requested, adding an eighth one which was that the “Court require Syria to take several immediate steps to reduce the risk of torture being committed by its officials and others within the system of detention.” He clarified that this includes “issuing instructions to all those involved in the detention system, [and at] checkpoints and hospitals to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with their inherent human dignity. They should also receive information and training on the prohibition against torture in accordance with Syria’s obligation under Article 10 of the Convention against Torture.” As it stands, the eight provisional measures as they appear in the court documents ad verbatim are: 1. Syria shall immediately take effective measures to cease and prevent all acts that amount to or contribute to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 2. In light of the greatly enhanced risk for detainees of being subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Syria shall immediately: cease arbitrary detention, and release all persons who are arbitrarily or unlawfully detained; cease all forms of incommunicado detention; allow access to all of its official and unofficial places of detention by independent monitoring mechanisms and medical personnel, and allow contact and visitations between detainees and their families and legal counsel; and; take urgent measures to improve the conditions of all of its official and unofficial detention facilities to ensure all detainees are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person in accordance with international standards; 3. Syria shall not destroy or render inaccessible any evidence related to the Application, including, without limitation, by destroying or rendering inaccessible medical or other records of injuries sustained as a result of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or the remains of any person who was a victim of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 4. Syria shall safeguard any information concerning the cause of death of any detainee who died while in detention or while hospitalised, including forensic examination of the human remains and places of burial, as well as afford the next of kin of any person who died as a result of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, following arrest, hospitalisation or detention with a death certificate, stating the true cause of death; 5. Syria shall disclose the location of the burial sites of persons who died as a result of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment following arrest, hospitalisation or detention, to the next of kin; 6. Syria shall not take any action, and shall ensure that no action is taken, which may aggravate or extend the existing dispute that is the subject of the Application, or render it more difficult to resolve; 7. Syria shall provide a report to the Court on all measures taken to give effect to its Order for provisional measures, beginning no later than six months from its issuance and every six months thereafter pending the resolution of the dispute; and. 8. Syria shall take immediate actions to reduce the risk of torture being committed by its officials and other personnel, including by issuing instructions to ensure that detainees are treated in accordance with their human dignity, suspending all personnel suspected of having committed torture or other ill-treatment pending investigation, lifting de facto immunity for those of its officials who commit torture, and ensuring that statements obtained under torture are not used as evidence in any proceedings. In closing, Mr. Kessel stressed that “Justice and accountability are crucial to breaking the cycle of violence and atrocities, and are important as a step towards building a sustainable peace in Syria.” He added that the detainees currently held in regime detention centers are under the threat of imminent death or severe physical and mental harm, which would also apply to anyone who might be detained in the future. “Over a decade of inaction has shown that Syria cannot be relied on to refrain, on its own volition and without a binding order from the Court, from inflicting heinous acts of torture and other ill-treatment against its population,” he added. Moreover, he underscored that thousands of individuals in Syria are still detained, which emphasizes the need to take urgent action to prevent more unnecessary deaths and suffering. Finally, he underlined that the provisional measures requested by the prosecution are “practical, realistic and consistent with the protections offered by the Court in its previous orders indicating provisional measures,” stressing that such provisions “are necessarily comprehensive in order to preserve the rights at issue in the case, which are quite literally a matter of life and death.” On its part, the Court expressed its regrets over the non-appearance of the Syrian regime in the oral proceedings. At the session’s conclusion, the Court revealed that it will render its Order in a public sitting. Following the session, Canada and The Netherlands issued a , in which they stressed that “they are guided by the strong conviction that there can be no sustainable peace and lasting reconciliation in Syria without justice for victims and survivors.” Reiterating their commitment to upholding international law, they also called on all states and the international community to support accountability efforts for Syrians. The statement also lamented the Syrian regime’s choice not to appear “in these important proceedings, particularly in light of the three-month postponement granted to facilitate its participation.” On October 10, 2023, SNHR released a report entitled, ‘The Syrian Regime is Accused of Killing 15,051 Individuals, Including 190 Children and 94 Women, Under Torture in Its Detention Centers Since March 2011, While Nearly 136,000 Remain Forcibly Disappeared’ , in which the group hailed the case brought by Canada and The Netherlands against the Syrian regime before the ICJ as a serious step on the path of accountability. As SNHR’s database attests, no fewer than 135,638 individuals, including 3,693 children and 8,478 women (adult female), of those arrested since March 2011 up until August 2023 are still under arrest. Of these, 96,103 individuals, including 2,327 children and 5,739 women (adult female) are classified as forcibly disappeared persons, with all of them being subjected to one or multiple forms of torture. SNHR has also documented 83 methods of torture used by the Syrian regime in its detention centers. Despite having ratified the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2004, the Syrian regime has failed to uphold its obligations under the Convention. On the contrary, the regime has practiced torture in the most monstrous and worst possible ways, as shown by the data included in this report, both at the level of execution and through passing local laws that only nominally criminalize torture in a limited, wholly superficial way, while affording impunity to those involved in perpetrating torture. Furthermore, the Syrian regime practices torture in a systematic and widespread manner, violating the right to life, which constitutes a blatant breach of international human rights law. It has been repeatedly proven that the Syrian regime leadership has full knowledge of these practices, and is fully aware that these inhumane detention conditions lead inevitably to detainees’ deaths. The Syrian regime has deliberately allowed for, and carried out such practices through a decision made by a hierarchy that begins from the President of the Republic; answering directly to him are the ministers of defense and interior and the National Security Bureau, and their affiliated security apparatuses. We, at SNHR, believe in the importance of this trial as a serious step on the path of long overdue accountability, after the Syrian regime has been given absolute impunity for 13 years. We hope the court will impose the harshest possible provisional measures against the Syrian regime, which is known for destroying evidence and for its refusal to cooperate with UN bodies, or international and local human rights organizations.",

UNFPA is here to ensure that they will receive appropriate services, especially for safe births,” said Jaime Nadal Roig, UNFPA’s representative in Afghanistan. Women and girls disproportionately affected. Most of those who died were women and children because they were in their houses while men were out to work. Displaced people are sheltering in abandoned buildings, makeshift shelters and tents, with some areas seeing every single home flattened by the disaster. Women-headed households are particularly vulnerable, with protection needs as well as challenges seeking and obtaining humanitarian assistance. Health teams and supplies deployed. Of the affected population, it is estimated that 3,028 are women of reproductive age, 1,414 are adolescent girls 10 to 19 years old, and 183 are likely to be currently pregnant and in need of midwifery care. UNFPA has deployed seven mobile health teams to quake-affected areas in Jibhrail, Zindajan and Shindani districts. Staff have also been deployed to the Herat Provincial Hospital, where survivors are being treated, and counsellors have arrived to provide psychosocial support services in temporary shelters. Dignity kits, containing hygiene supplies such as soap, underwear and menstrual pads, are also being distributed, with further distribution of blankets, tarpaulin, and supplies for safe childbirth and for postpartum mothers and newborns also planned. “We need hygiene kits, clothes and footwear because we lost everything when our homes were reduced into rubble,” said one woman, sheltering at a medical school within the Herat Provincial Hospital grounds.",

          "fullText": "11 October 2023 The climate crisis is the greatest health challenge of the 21st century. The mean temperature is increasing rapidly and other climatic variables are worsening and these changes are occurring twice as fast in the Eastern Mediterranean Region as elsewhere in the world. The health impacts of climate change are substantial and include more deadly extreme weather events, increasing cases of noncommunicable diseases and the increased emergence and spread of infectious diseases. These impacts are already affecting the Region’s health workforce and infrastructure, reducing the capacity to achieve universal health coverage. Deep, rapid and sustained climate mitigation efforts and faster implementation of climate adaptation actions would reduce the projected damages and losses for humans and ecosystems. Further delays in acting on climate change will increase the risks and undermine decades of public health gains. Failing to act now will also contravene our collective commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals and the human right to health for all. As we speed towards 2030, WHO proposes a new regional framework for action to build climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems; to prioritize health in climate change policies; to engage the health sector effectively to support climate action by other sectors; to improve the health sector’s access to climate change funding; and to build a robust evidence base for policy-making. The framework is proposed for the period 20232029. Achieving these targets will require multisectoral transformative action across society. This includes: working within formal health systems; collaborating with health-determining sectors, such as energy, food, agriculture, water, transport, social affairs, security and finance; and; engaging with the general public to make a critical contribution to combating and adapting to climate change and accelerating progress towards health for all. Thirteen countries of the Region need to accelerate action through the Alliance on Transformative Action on Climate and Health. The remaining countries and territories of the Region are urged to join this WHO-led initiative. A technical report on climate change, which introduces the proposed framework for action, will be discussed at the 70th session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean. The report’s aim is to support every country and territory of the Region to commit to the Alliance and to accelerate action on climate change.",

After multiple aftershocks and a second earthquake of the same magnitude early on 11 October, the UN and the authorities are reporting between 1,000 and 3,000 deaths. These numbers are expected to rise in the next hours and days. In the village at the epicentre of the first earthquake, every single building has been flattened. Across the province, many families are sleeping out in the streets. Several hundred are reported missing, according to the UN. Those affected by the disaster are still searching for relatives amidst the rubble and are seeking out assistance from aid agencies and authorities. According to the latest UN OCHA report, an estimated 12,110 people have been affected by the earthquake across five districts in Herat province. Yet another shock for an already fragile Afghanistan. The humanitarian aid system in Afghanistan is already desperately overstretched and underfunded, with over 29 million Afghans already in need of humanitarian assistance. The country’s food rations from the World Food Programme have also recently been reduced substantially due to funding cuts, leaving millions of families without enough to eat. As winter approaches, there are concerns about how affected communities are going to survive. The road to recovery for Afghans will be long and difficult. We are on the ground ready to respond. On the ground, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) emergency teams are coordinating between affected communities, Afghan authorities and other NGOs to help those impacted as quickly as possible. Our response will be split between addressing immediate needs such as emergency shelter, blankets and site coordination, and more long-term planning to support affected communities to recover post emergency. NRC has been present in Afghanistan since 2003, working in 14 provinces to assist people affected by displacement from conflict and disasters.",

D'un point de vue environnemental, les périodes de sécheresse combinées à d'autres événements climatiques défavorables contribuent à éroder de précieuses ressources naturelles et à alimenter les tensions entre différents groupes sociaux, tels que les bergers et les agriculteurs, pour le contrôle des terres et des sources d'eau. Les effets combinés de tous ces phénomènes contribuent à l'augmentation du nombre de personnes déplacées et de migrants. Dans ce contexte, le travail de COOPI sur le terrain s'est toujours caractérisé par des interventions de riposte à l’urgence et aussi par la mise en uvre de programmes de développement visant à renforcer la résilience des communautés. L'instabilité politique, la présence de groupes armés, la pauvreté et les dommages causés par le changement climatique rendent la plupart des pays de la région centrale de l'Afrique très fragiles. Malgré ces difficultés, COOPI est présent dans cette zone depuis près de cinquante ans avec des projets qui - outre la composante de gestion des urgences - visent à promouvoir les processus de développement et à réduire la forte vulnérabilité des communautés dans lesquelles il opère. Les programmes mis en uvre dans la région se concentrent sur la protection, l'éducation d'urgence, la nutrition, l'accès à l'eau et la sécurité alimentaire à travers une étroite collaboration avec les institutions et les organisations actives dans la région et à l'implication active des communautés bénéficiaires.

          "fullText": "Gates Foundation Celebrates 20 Years of “Grand Challenges” With New Investments and a Call to Make R&D Breakthroughs Available More Quickly and Equitably    Commitments focus on advancing equitable access to artificial intelligence (AI) and vaccines, and catalyzing innovations that address women’s health. DAKAR and SEATTLE (October 10, 2023) A slate of new initiatives to support locally led innovation was announced today in Dakar by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its partners at the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting. The investments come with an urgent call for countries to step up funding to make the research and development (R&D) of health and development innovations easier and faster, and to make the next generation of scientific and technological breakthroughs relevant and accessible to all. Data shows that while overall health R&D funding is increasing, only about 2% is directed toward diseases that affect the world’s poorest people. In 2020, the annual funding gap for product development targeting poverty-related and neglected diseases was estimated at US$2.6 billion. “Over the past two decades, global investments in a pipeline of innovative solutions helped reduce childhood deaths under 5 by half,” said Moussa Balde, Senegal’s minister for higher education, research and innovation. “But lifesaving innovations still take too long to reach those who need them and are not always designed with equity from the start. Grand Challenges Senegal continues to invest in the country's brightest scientists and innovators, and we are pleased to be part of this global network of Grand Challenges partners investing in locally led solutions to ensure innovations, including in health, education, and agriculture, benefit everyone equally.” Launched in 2003, Grand Challenges, the foundation’s flagship innovation program, focuses attention and funding on pressing global health and development problems that affect the world’s poorest people, using open calls for proposals to crowdsource potential solutions. In an address to the more than 1,400 scientists, policymakers, and donors attending the annual meeting, Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, called for the world to spend at least US$3 billion more every year on global health and development R&D in order to close the critical gaps in funding for neglected diseases. “New health technologies have the potential to save millions of lives, but R&D funding is going in the wrong direction,” said Gates. “Donors need to step up their commitments to ensure health innovations reach those who need them more quickly, so more lives can be saved.' Today, Gates announced that the foundation is investing US$30 million to support a new artificial intelligence (AI) platform in Africa. The platform will provide African scientists and innovators with the technical and operational support they need to turn promising ideas into scalable health and development solutions. It is a step towards ensuring the benefits of AI are relevant, affordable, and accessible to everyoneparticularly those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)and that these critical tools are developed safely, ethically, and equitably. The foundation will continue to work closely with technical partners and governments to further advance the platform and identify opportunities to jointly advance Yesterday, the foundation also announced new investments aimed at expanding access to a novel mRNA vaccine manufacturing platform that gives countries, including Senegal and South Africa, the technology to develop and manufacture their own vaccines. mRNA technology is considered a potential game-changer for a range of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, and Lassa fever, which disproportionately affect people in LMICs. This additional local vaccine manufacturing capacity will support LMICs to develop low-cost, high-quality vaccines that address their most urgent health priorities. “What started as a single program funded by the Gates Foundation and its partners has grown into a family of initiatives and partnerships across national borders, fields of study, and sectors that catalyze research, products, and partnerships to save and improve the lives of the world’s most vulnerable people,” said Kedest Tesfagiorgis, deputy director, Global Partnerships and Grand Challenges at the foundation. “Our community of brilliant innovators is proof that a great idea can come from anywhere and be supported by the funders, policymakers, and advocates needed to move ideas into the laboratory and, ultimately, to the people who can most benefit from them.” Grand Challenges is supported by the governments of China, India, Brazil, the United States, and Canada, as well as a growing number of countries in Africa, including Ethiopia, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa. Since 2003, partners have invested US$1.6 billion to support more than 3,800 projects in 118 countriesfrom new strategies to improve gut health in moms and children to reinventing the toilet for improved sanitation to reimagining drug discovery research for malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases. To further support scientists developing cutting-edge innovations in LMICs, the foundation and its partners also issued new calls for proposals in the following areas: Equitable AI for health in LMICs. Building on a to develop global health and development solutions in LMICs using AI-enabled large language models (LLMs), GC partners issued a request for proposals of up to US$5.5 million to help advance the development of robust, locally relevant, AI-empowered tools to expedite decision-making, policy pathways, and implementation by frontline health workers and policymakers. The call is led by GC Brazil, GC India, GC Ethiopia, GC Senegal, GC South Africa, and GC Africa, with support from GC Canada, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, the Pasteur Network, and the Gates Foundation. Women’s health R&D to unlock the potential of half the world’s population and unleash a powerful engine for progress. The is a new report outlining 50 equitable, high-return opportunities across the R&D continuum to maximize research and innovation, investments, and global action in women’s health. To encourage innovations and ideas laid out in the Opportunity Map, the foundation announced a new request for proposals that will provide up to US$3.6 million in funding. Innovations in global health and development across other critical areas of need. The full list of new requests for proposals can be found The 2023 Grand Challenges Annual Meeting in Dakar is hosted by the Global Grand Challenges network of partners and the government of Senegal, and sponsored by Grand Challenges Canada, the United States Agency for International Development, Wellcome, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. About Grand Challenges. The Grand Challenges family of programs stems from a century-old idea that crowdsourcing solutions to a defined set of unsolved problems can spark innovation and accelerate progress. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its Grand Challenges funding partners first used Challengesopen requests for grant proposalsin 2003 to focus attention and effort on pressing global health and development problems for those most in need. Together, Grand Challenges partners have awarded US$1.6 billion across 3,800 grants to a diverse pool of problem solvers in 118 countries, while at the same time fostering a global innovation ecosystem in places where it will have the most impact. The foundation and its Grand Challenges partners will continue to launch RFPs to support innovators from around the world in tackling the hardest, most urgent Grand Challenges.

          "fullText": "ADDIS ABABA, 11 October 2023 On International Day of the Girl, Save the Children has released a series of double exposure portraits by Maheder Haileselassie Tadese, winner of the 2023 Contemporary African Photography Prize, showing the devastating impact of severe drought on girls’ lives in Ethiopia. Five failed rainy seasons across the Horn of Africa have left up to 20 million people in Ethiopia food insecure. Girls in parts of the country hit by drought and food shortages are increasingly being forced into child marriage, with rates rising by 119% in 2022.[1] Maheder Haileselassie Tadese spent time with girls in the Somali region, capturing their experiences on the front line of climate change. Bone-dry water sources, decimated crops and dying livestock had combined with vicious conflict to make early marriage a threat to all of them. Maheder said:* “It struck me that the girls’ experience of child marriage story was linked to the changing climate. Recurrent drought in the Somali region means that the earth no longer provides families and their livestock with the water and nutritious food that they need. This is why I made the drought-affected landscape and dried river an integral part of each portrait, to represent how child marriage and climate change intertwine.”* The award-winning photographer's double exposure approach captures portraitsof the girls alongside photographs representing their memories, hopes and fears. The creative images also feature the resources pastoralist families depend on for survival amid the arid landscapes that have wiped them out. Together these layers represent the factors pushing families towards child marriage along with the strength of the girls and their communities to resist. Girls who marry young face harsh and far-reaching consequences. They are far less likely to stay in school, with lifelong economic impacts. Child brides are also at greater risk of experiencing dangerous complications in pregnancy and childbirth. They are often isolated, and at higher risk of lifelong physical and sexual violence. A new report released yesterday by Save the Children “ Girls at the centre of the storm: Her planet, her future, her solutions *” *reveals that the number of girls living in high risk ‘hotspots’ for child marriage and climate change is set to increase by one third, to nearly 40 million by 2050. [2] Asma*, was aged 14 when a man expressed his interest in marrying her. As pastoralists impacted by droughts, her parents felt that marrying early could offer her a better quality of life. Supported by Save the Children, Asma* was able to avoid the marriage and now campaigns against early marriage in her community. “*The drought affects my family because our animals are our only income. * Before the drought we had milk and meat, but when drought comes there is no milk, there is no meat. And there is a serious problem with scarcity of water and our livestock have no water to drink. “When I was 14 years old, a man wanted to marry me and my parents agreed. I became unhappy and withdrawn at school, I was depressed.**Because he was a wealthier person than us, my parents advised me that if I got married to him my life would become better than theirs. Aida*, 20, was married aged 15 after being displaced due to conflict and drought. She was devastated at the time and had to leave school. After a few months in this forced marriage, she became depressed and with the support of her uncle, she fled to the nearby city to escape before returning to live with her family when it was safe. “Since being displaced, life has been difficult. We used to plough in our fields. We grew and ate whatever we wanted from our garden. Now we have nothing to eat, we are suffering a lot, we live in a shack house and the heat is terrible. We are just living here in the hope that it will pass. “I was married at the age of 15. My parents married me off thinking our problems would become easier. They gave me to this man to alleviate our troubles. I told them that I would rather die than living with this man.” Lelo*, 15, avoided early marriage at 14. Her parents agreed to the marriage because their family were struggling economically due to losing their livestock during the drought. “The land was fertile and green. The animals were healthy and fat. The land was once fertile, but the following year, there was a severe drought. The animals died. Even the plants dried up. I swear the weather changed. Heat, wind, and storms came. When I was 14, I was proposed to. The man proposed to my family, and I was informed when I arrived [home]. I was demoralized.” Data analysis published in *Girls at the centre of the storm *shows that the situation is likely to get worse estimating that between now and 2030, almost 60% of girls, some 931 million, will experience at least one extreme weather event, like flooding, drought or heatwaves. Maheder Haileselassie Tadese ** winner of the 2023 Contemporary African Photography Prize, said:** *“I met girls who had been married when they were just 14, forced to leave school because their families were desperate for economic support. For Aida*’s portrait I used images of sorghum and maize, because she described happy memories of her family growing crops and fresh fruits before she was displaced and forced to marry aged 14. When one looks closely, the tree * branches on Saeda*’s face look almost like a vein, a metaphor to what trees, land and a good climate means to her and her community. Camels are for her memory of the camels her family lost during the drought. “But I also wanted to capture the strength and power of the girls campaigning against child marriage. Their determination to help more girls stay in education and fulfil their dreams was important.” Xavier Joubert, Country Director for ** Save the Children Ethiopia says:** “*These powerful photographs illustrate just how vulnerable girls are to extreme weather events like drought. Drought ruins livelihoods, increasing food shortages and poverty. Many girls face the consequences of either having to leave school or marry far too young. No child should lose their childhood to the effects of climate change. * “It’s vital we promote gender equality, put girls at the heart of our climate action efforts and take steps to reduce gender-based violence and child marriage. Governments must increase support to girls and other children most at risk, and above all, accelerate their efforts to end child marriage and stop this abuse of girls’ rights.” Save the Children has been operating inEthiopiafor over 60 years with its work focused on health and nutrition as well as life-saving water and sanitation assistance, protection services, education support, and cash and in-kind distributions. In 2022, Save the Children reached about 7.6 million people including 5.1 million children. NOTES TO EDITORS: References: [[1]] UNICEF. (2022).",

          "fullText": "This week, we spoke to Nicole Ntagabo, MAG’s Regional Director for the Sahel and West Africa. First off, can you summarise our activities in the Sahel and West Africa? MAG has been present in the region for more than 10 years, working to prevent and reduce the harmful impact of conflicts on populations. In that sense, MAG has been supporting Small Arms & Light Weapons (SALW) control and Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) efforts, collaborating with national and regional authorities as well as various expert organisations and institutions. Today, MAG’s Armed Violence Reduction (AVR) work focuses on three main areas: reducing the impact of armed violence on communities through risk reduction strategies; mitigating the risks of unplanned explosions at munition sites, as well as the risk posed by the illicit diversion of weapons; and supporting states and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in their national SALW control objectives, strategies, and compliance with instruments. In addition, MAG’s HMA work focuses on developing national mine action centres and institutional capacities to respond more effectively to legacy and new contaminations. It also reduces risks of accidents and the impact of explosive ordnance through risk education, non-technical survey, and clearance where possible; and supports states to fulfil their international obligations in line with the Antipersonnel Mine Ban Convention (APMBC) and the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM). What are the main drivers of instability and violence in the region that MAG aims to counter/respond to? A complex web of drivers of instability and violence contribute to the region's challenges. A lot of these drivers are interconnected, making it very important for MAG to understand the contexts in which our work is taking place. The consolidation of non-state armed groups in the Sahel since the beginning of the war in Libya in 2011 has destabilized already fragile institutions, contributing to political instability. Climate change, desertification, and droughts have disrupted livelihoods, particularly in rural areas heavily dependent on agriculture and pastoralism. Competition over scarce land and resources, as well as political power, often result in communal tensions, which have fuelled conflicts within countries. Non-state armed groups often exploit these grievances, and weak governance, to recruit and expand their influence in new places where central states have difficulties to provide essential services and maintain security. This has resulted in a spill over of violence from country to country. The instability, and the associated spread of violence, has largely been fuelled by the proliferation of SALW in the region. Weapons often flow across porous borders, contributing to the intensity and duration of conflicts. SALW trafficking in West Africa is fed by easy access to stockpiles of arms and facilitated by weak responses from regional state security providers who often lack resources, capacity, or political support. In addition, the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) has also become one of the most common modus operandi of non-state armed groups in the region and while it appears that the intended targets are the defence and security forces, more and more civilians are indiscriminately killed and maimed. Can you give an example of a particularly successful initiative that MAG has recently conducted? MAG has been developing its partnership approach, working hand in hand with a diverse range of local civil society actors who possess deep insights into the communities they serve. Their presence and credibility enhance the acceptance and impact of all our initiatives, especially risk education activities. They often establish networks that facilitate access to vulnerable populations, ensuring that life-saving information reaches those who need it most. We are really pleased to witness the growth and development of our local partners, becoming stronger, more influential, and increasingly professional and technical in their capacities. It not only reflects the efficacy of our partnership but also holds significant implications for our broader mission. **What impact does MAG’s work have on local people and communities? ** The impact of ongoing and past conflicts in the Sahel and West Africa is multifaceted, with significant humanitarian, social, and economic consequences. MAG works diligently to reach the largest possible number of people with life-saving information on contamination. This is particularly critical for children and returning communities as it enables safer humanitarian access and development in the future. Our efforts with SALW and ammunition also prevent and reduce the risks of accidents, allowing individuals and communities to feel secure in their living environments. What are the main challenges of MAG’s work in Sahel and West Africa? The region is unfortunately becoming increasingly complex due to deteriorating security conditions and political instability. Populations are particularly affected in border areas where the presence of states and the services they offer are limited, which creates a vacuum that non-state armed groups exploit by recruiting young people who lack economic opportunities, which perpetuates cycles of violence. Humanitarian organisations like MAG face difficulties in reaching the communities in need in environments that are increasingly volatile. Being conflict-sensitive and balancing humanitarian principles with our work and access to population is therefore critical for MAG. Finally, mobilizing resources in the region is challenging, especially in the current global context, where MAG and other organisations are operating in a very resource-constrained setting, and where needs continue to be on the rise. What does the next five years look like for MAG in Sahel and West Africa? MAG's work remains incredibly relevant and important in the face of the serious security and humanitarian challenges in the region. Our strategy centres on working closely with trusted partners at various levels to develop sustainable capacities that can effectively tackle the region's diverse challenges, which vary from one country to another. We'll assist states that lack the capacity to deal with new contamination, helping them establish the necessary capabilities to fulfil their obligations under the APMBC, especially as conflict situations evolve. We recognise that our skilled workforce is at the heart of our success. So, we're dedicated to investing in our staff, ensuring they have the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complex challenges in the Sahel and West Africa effectively.",

USD 73.8 million net funding requirements across all activities for the next six months (September-February 2023) 1.76 million people assisted in July 2023. Food Security Situation The 2023 Long Rains Food and Nutrition Security Assessment carried out in 23 arid and semi-arid counties revealed a significant reduction in acute food insecurity levels. The assessment indicated that 2.8 million Kenyans are acutely food insecure, down from 4.4 million in February 2023. Out of this, 2.3 million individuals are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), while 0.5 million are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). The primary drivers of food and nutrition insecurity include poor rainfall distribution, the cumulative impact of previous poor rainfall seasons, elevated staple food prices, expensive agricultural inputs, and poor dietary intake among children, among others. The improved food security situation can be attributed to favourable rainfall during the March to May season, with further progress anticipated due to forecasted positive rainfall patterns in the upcoming October to December period, attributed to El-Nino conditions. Improvements in the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition were observed. This is attributed to expanded drought response efforts and the enhanced food security situation. Despite this positive trend, arid counties still experience elevated levels of acute malnutrition with extreme critical phases identified, in Turkana South sub-county. The number of acute malnutrition cases among children aged 6 to 59 months decreased to 947,000 in July 2023, from 970,000 in February, while 144,940 pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls (PBWGs) are currently affected by acute malnutrition. There is need for continued interventions to address malnutrition and enhance well-being.",

Christian Aid's Director of Policy, Public Affairs and Campaigns, Osai Ojigho, said: 'We are gravely concerned by the mounting death toll across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory and unequivocally condemn the violence. 'All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and unconditionally agree to protect civilians and key services, starting with establishing safe humanitarian corridors as requested by the UN. 'With the people of Gaza already on their knees, the UK Government must not cut aid to the Palestinian people. We need that commitment today. As we pray for an end to the conflict, international leaders must also act and help secure a lasting peace that achieves justice and dignity for all.' William Bell, Christian Aid's Head of Middle East Policy & Advocacy, added: 'Our civil society partners in Gaza have told us that hospitals are overwhelmed by casualties and shops are running out of goods such as bread and baby milk. They stand ready to respond with medical relief and community-led initiatives such as food, shelter, sanitation and protection.' Notes to editors: Christian Aid has been working with the poorest and most vulnerable people in the Middle East since the early 1950s, when we provided humanitarian relief to Palestinian refugees. Today, as Palestinians continue to experience exile, blockade, relentless spikes in violence and huge increases in land dispossession, we work with Palestinian and Israeli partners to protect human rights and promote resilience for Palestinian communities and civil society. All our work aims to support the foundations for a just, lasting peace for all. Protect, promote and defend human rights for the protection of Palestinians in the Middle East. Strengthen the resilience of individuals, communities and institutions, so they can respond when faced with threats to their lives, land and livelihoods. Deliver humanitarian responses that are accountable, impartial and strengthen local capacity.",

          "fullText": "Area general updates Nearly 175,500 internally displaced people are sheltering in 88 UNRWA schools across the Gaza Strip. The numbers continue to increase as airstrikes continue from the Israeli Air Forces. UNRWA staff are working around the clock to respond to the needs of the displaced in the shelters. However, some are overcrowded and have limited availability of food, other basic items and potable water. UNRWA has over 5,300 UNRWA workers managing shelters. In coordination with the World Food Programme (WFP), bread was distributed to the displaced people in the shelters. Two UNRWA schools were affected by airstrikes, bringing the total number of installations affected by the conflict to 20 since 7 October. Turmoil in major Palestinian cities has been reported and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli Forces around checkpoints and settlements across the West Bank. The Israeli Authorities closed all crossings from the West Bank into East Jerusalem and Israel for Palestinian ID holders, including UN and International NGOs staff. Movements between governorates and cities within the West Bank remains challenging, as ad hoc closures and restrictions are put in place by Israeli Authorities., Closures of checkpoints around East Jerusalem were partially eased while flying checkpoints were set up at entrances of Palestinian neighborhoods in the city. All checkpoints isolating parts of the Israeli-controlled area of Hebron (H2) from the rest of the city were closed for the third consecutive day, impeding the movement of 7,000 Palestinian residents and restricting them from accessing basic services like health and education. essential services. Protection of Civilians According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 900 people were killed including 290 children. Another 4,250 were injured since 7 October in the Gaza Strip. Thirty (30) UNRWA students (17 girls and 13 boys) have been killed and another eight were injured (six boys and two girls). Nine UNRWA personnel (six staff and three contractors) were killed, while three teachers were injured. 16 internally displaced people sheltering at an UNRWA school were injured, including two critically, as a result of an airstrike nearby. In the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), 17 Palestinians were killed including four children. Of these, three were Palestine Refugees, including one child. Meanwhile, another 295 were reported injured (OCHA oPt). According to Israeli sources, 1,000 people were killed in Israel. Education All UNRWA schools across the Gaza Strip, including the Rehabilitation Centre for Visually Impaired and the two vocational centres in Gaza and Khan Younis remain closed. Some are being considered to become shelters as the number of internally displaced continues to increase. In the West Bank, most UNRWA schools have remained open, operating at limited capacity, through teachers and staff living close to schools. Some of the schools in hotspot locations, including Hebron H2, remained closed, and turned to remote learning. Health Only 11 (out of 22) UNRWA Health Centres across the Gaza Strip are able to provide primary healthcare services from 9:00 to 12:30 to patients with urgent referred appointments received through the free-toll hotline. 111 health staff (12 % of total health staff) are present at the health centres. Emergency health-care services through the toll-free hotline continue across all areas. With needs increasing on the ground and the conflict intensifying, UNRWA is looking into scaling up its capacity in the accessible health centers mobilizing more staff and opening for longer hours, whilst ensuring personnel security and safety. As of 14:00 hrs, 1,248 callers used the toll-free hotline and were provided with services. Medicines were delivered to the health centres from its central pharmacy. Pharmacy stocks are not affected by shortages for now. One UNRWA health centre in Jabalia (north of the Gaza Strip) is likely to run out of medicines in the next 14 days. Local community continues to appeal to UNRWA to open closed health centres due to high demand for health services. In the West Bank, most UNRWA health centres are open, also operating at limited capacity, due to movement and access restrictions. Sanitation Services All solid waste collection and transfer to landfill activities remain on hold. Transfer of solid waste from shelters to the landfills has started. Water wells in Jabalia, Khan Younis and Rafah are functional with about 9,000 cubic metres pumped from nine water wells. Provision of potable water through tankers continues to several designated emergency shelters in the Khan Younis area. Emergency repair of water network at Jabalia water well was carried out. 40 sanitation workers are working on the operation of all sanitation activities. In the West Bank, sanitation labourers removed garbage in the camps. Due to limited movement, challenges were reported with moving waste from the transfer stations in the camps to the landfills. Relief and Social Services Nearly half a million people (112,000 families) have not been able to get their food rations since UNRWA food distribution centres closed on 7 October; Helplines are operational and Psychological First Aid provided remotely. 33 social workers are available to provide psychosocial support remotely. General UNRWA operations; With an increased number of schools sheltering the internally displaced, additional mobile toilets and showers are being deployed. UNRWA distributed mattresses, mats, blankets and jerrycans in the designated emergency shelters. People with specific needs are prioritized as the quantity is insufficient to cover all needs. Maintenance work (with 31 staff) is carried out in 35 UNRWA emergency shelters. Staff movement remains restricted except for staff providing services. UNRWA Installations An UNRWA school in the Middle Area was affected by collateral damage due to an airstrike that hit a building adjacent to the school. Shrapnel was also found in the schoolyard. UN Common Premises Compound, which hosts UNRWA Gaza Field Office, OCHA, UNDSS, UNMAS, and UNRWA GAZA HQ, sustained major damage to most structures due to nearby airstrikes. A number of UNRWA assets were destroyed, including vehicles, fuel and water stores. At least 60 UNRWA staff were on the compound at the time.

Se trata de erradicar la poliomielitis y de velar por que las innovaciones en materia de salud lleguen mejor a las personas que más las necesitan.",
          "fullText": "La Comisión Europea, el Banco Europeo de Inversiones y Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation han anunciado hoy un nuevo acuerdo de financiación para iniciativas sanitarias críticas a escala mundial. Se trata de erradicar la poliomielitis y de velar por que las innovaciones en materia de salud lleguen mejor a las personas que más las necesitan. La Organización Mundial de la Salud y UNICEF, como socios ejecutantes para la financiación destinada a la poliomielitis, invertirán los recursos para erradicar esa enfermedad, apoyar la distribución de otras inmunizaciones infantiles y reforzar los sistemas sanitarios para que puedan reaccionar mejor ante nuevas amenazas para la salud. La dotación prevista por valor de 1 100 millones de euros tiene por objeto facilitar nueva financiación para erradicar una enfermedad humana por segunda vez en la historia y contribuirá a resolver los problemas de salud y desarrollo que sufren las personas más vulnerables del mundo, que de otro modo no obtendrían un acceso justo a los servicios e innovaciones en materia de asistencia sanitaria. La presidenta de la Comisión Europea, Ursula von der Leyen, ha declarado: Estamos a punto de desterrar la poliomielitis de la faz de la Tierra. La Comisión Europea, el BEI y la Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation cooperan para recorrer el tramo final. Invertiremos 1 000 millones de euros con cargo a nuestra estrategia de inversión europea Global Gateway en sistemas sanitarios más sólidos a escala mundial y en la producción, la fabricación y la administración locales de vacunas y medicamentos, allí donde más se necesiten. La cooperación mundial nos ha ayudado a poner fin a la pandemia de COVID-19. Ahora nos ayudará a deshacernos de la poliomielitis de una vez por todas. El acuerdo supone un aumento considerable de la financiación destinada a la salud y el desarrollo humano a escala mundial, con cargo al Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Sostenible Plus (FEDS+) de la Comisión Europea, y se prevé que incluya nuevos fondos complementarios para la salud mundial aportados por Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, maximizando así el efecto de cada euro comprometido por la UE y el Banco Europeo de Inversiones. Werner Hoyer, presidente del Banco Europeo de Inversiones, ha afirmado: Hoy nos unimos para escribir el último capítulo de la historia de la poliomielitis. El Banco Europeo de Inversiones va a desempeñar su cometido en esta cooperación única con socios del mundo de la salud y de la filantropía al aportar 500 millones de euros para inversiones en apoyo del Programa Global de Erradicación de Polio. Esta iniciativa será un hito en la difusión de la inmunización y el refuerzo de la asistencia sanitaria, de manera que todos los niños, independientemente de sus circunstancias, puedan ser protegidos contra la poliomielitis. Para promover un rápido avance hacia la erradicación del poliovirus silvestre, la asociación tiene previsto aportar 500 millones de euros en pagos a la Iniciativa Mundial de Erradicación de la Poliomelitis, y concretamente a la Organización Mundial de la Salud y UNICEF. Con esos fondos se sufragará la vacunación contra la poliomielitis de casi 370 millones de niños al año; se prestarán servicios sanitarios vitales a los niños con ocasión de las campañas contra la poliomielitis, por ejemplo, vacunas contra el sarampión y otras inmunizaciones rutinarias; y se reforzarán los sistemas sanitarios para prepararse y responder mejor a nuevas amenazas para la salud, como ha hecho el programa de la poliomelitis contra la COVID-19, el ébola y otras enfermedades. En la actualidad, el poliovirus salvaje sigue siendo endémico en solo dos países (Pakistán y Afganistán) y el 80 % de los casos de poliovirus de la variante se localiza tan solo en cuatro de sus regiones. Bill Gates, copresidente de Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation*, ha dicho: Gracias a las innovaciones médicas, el mundo erradicó una enfermedad humana, la viruela. Hoy estamos a punto de acabar con otra, la provocada por el poliovirus salvaje. Me comprometo a garantizar que ningún niño, en ningún lugar del mundo, sufra esta terrible enfermedad. También confío en que erradicaremos la poliomielitis de una vez por todas y haremos que las innovaciones sanitarias sean más accesibles para todos, especialmente en los países más pobres*. Otros 500 millones de euros están previstos para ampliar la capacidad de innovación de los sistemas sanitarios en los países de renta baja y media. Esto abarca nuevos fondos para iniciativas respaldadas por la Comisión Europea, por ejemplo, esfuerzos por hacer que las innovaciones sanitarias como las vacunas y las terapias basadas en el ARN, sean más accesibles para los habitantes de países de renta baja y media, con cargo al plan europeo de inversiones mundiales, Global Gateway. Los dirigentes y socios mundiales estudiarán más inversiones en salud en todo el mundo en el próximo    (25 y 26 de octubre). Melinda French Gates, copresidenta de Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, ha hecho las observaciones siguientes: Gracias al liderazgo y la cooperación de la Comisión Europea y el Banco Europeo de Inversiones, las vacunas, los medicamentos y otras innovaciones que salvan vidas deberían llegar a las personas que más los necesitan, mejorando así la salud de las comunidades en todas partes. Sabemos que, cuando una comunidad es sana, la economía crece. El Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general de la OMS, ha comentado: Llegar a niños no vacunados o poco vacunados en las zonas más remotas y de difícil acceso es esencial para culminar la labor de erradicar la poliomielitis. Estos nuevos fondos no solo contribuirán a que avancemos hacia un mundo libre de poliomelitis, sino que también ayudarán a crear sistemas sanitarios más sostenibles y resilientes a fin de proteger a los mismos niños y comunidades expuestos al peligro de la poliomielitis frente a otras muchas amenazas para su salud. Catherine Russell, directora ejecutiva de UNICEF, ha afirmado: La erradicación de la poliomielitis está al alcance, pero los avances son frágiles y debemos seguir bien centrados. Esta nueva financiación contribuirá a garantizar que todos los niños sean vacunados para erradicar la poliomielitis, y reforzará a la vez los sistemas sanitarios comunitarios. Ningún niño debe padecer una enfermedad fácil de prevenir. En concreto, el acuerdo de financiación prevé lo siguiente: Nuevos fondos por valor de 500 millones de euros para la Iniciativa Mundial de Erradicación de Polio, tal como se ha indicado. 500 millones de euros en concepto de inversiones y subvenciones para garantizar que las innovaciones sanitarias sean más accesibles, refuercen los sistemas sanitarios y preparen para futuras pandemias: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation tiene previsto aportar 250 millones de euros en subvenciones e inversiones para igualar el importe de 250 millones de euros en inversiones realizadas por el Banco Europeo de Inversiones y garantizadas por el Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Sostenible Plus. Subvenciones por valor de 80 millones de euros para asistencia técnica: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation prevé aportar 40 millones de euros para igualar las subvenciones concedidas por la Comisión Europea a fin de prestar asistencia técnica y velar por que los programas de salud mundiales aprovechen todo su potencial. El acuerdo anunciado hoy se basa en las asociaciones existentes entre Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation y la Comisión Europea y los Estados miembros, incluido un paquete de ayudas por valor de 100 millones de euros para la Agencia Africana de Medicamentos (AMA) recientemente creada y las agencias nacionales africanas de regulación de los medicamentos o iniciativas regionales, la Plataforma Africana de Diagnósticos Sanitarios, que ayuda a los socios africanos a mejorar el acceso a las pruebas de laboratorio y a reducir sus costes, y la coordinación de iniciativas sanitarias como COVAX , una colaboración a escala mundial para acelerar el desarrollo, la producción y el acceso equitativo a las pruebas, tratamientos y vacunas contra la COVID-19.

          "fullText": "Attachments Today, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a new financing partnership to address critical global health opportunities: eradicating polio and ensuring that innovations in health are more accessible to the people who need them most. The World Health Organization and UNICEF, as implementing partners for the polio funding, will deploy the resources to eradicate polio, support the distribution of other childhood immunizations and strengthen health systems so they are better able to respond to emerging health threats. The expected €1.1 billion financing package aims to provide new funding to eradicate a human disease for only the second time in history and help solve the health and development challenges faced by the world's most vulnerable people, who otherwise do not get fair access to healthcare services and innovations. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: 'We are about to wipe polio off the face of the Earth. The European Commission, the EIB and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are partnering to get through the final stretch. With 1 billion euros supported by our European investment strategy Global Gateway, we will invest in stronger health systems globally and local vaccine and medicines production, manufacturing and administration, where it is most needed. Global cooperation has helped us put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it will help us get rid of polio once and for all.' The partnership marks a significant increase in funding for global health and human development under the European Commission's European Fund for Sustainable Development plus (EFSD+) and is expected to include a match of new complementary funding for global health by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, maximising the impact of every Euro committed by the EU and the European Investment Bank. 'Today we are united to write the final chapter in the history of polio. The European Investment Bank is playing its part in a unique partnership with philanthropy and health partners, by providing EUR 500 million for investment in support of the Global Polio Eradication Programme. This initiative will be a milestone in scaling up immunization and strengthening healthcare, ensuring that every child, regardless of their circumstances, can be protected against polio,' said Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank. To promote swift progress towards eradicating wild poliovirus, the partnership aims to deliver €500 million in payments to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative -- specifically the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The funds will cover polio vaccinations for nearly 370 million children annually; deliver vital health services to children alongside polio campaigns, including measles vaccines and other routine immunizations; and strengthen health systems to better prepare and respond to emerging health threats, as the polio program has done against COVID-19, Ebola, and other diseases. Today, wild poliovirus remains endemic in just two countries -- Pakistan and Afghanistan -- and 80% of variant poliovirus cases are found in just four subnational regions. 'Thanks to medical innovations, the world eradicated one human disease -- smallpox. Today we're on the verge of ending another -- wild poliovirus. I am committed to ensuring that no child, anywhere in the world, faces this awful disease. I am also optimistic that we will eradicate polio once and for all and make health innovations more accessible for everyone, particularly those in the poorest countries,' said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Another €500 million aims to expand the innovation capacity of health systems in low- and middle-income countries. This includes new funding to initiatives supported by the European Commission such as efforts to make health innovations like mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics more accessible to people in low- and middle-income countries, under Europe's investment plan for the world, Global Gateway. More investments in health worldwide will be discussed among global leaders and partners at the upcoming (25-26 October) 'Thanks to the leadership and partnership of the European Commission and European Investment Bank, vaccines, medicines and other life-saving innovations should reach the people who need them most, making communities everywhere healthier. We know that when a community is healthy, economies grow,' said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 'Reaching un- or under-vaccinated children in the most remote and hardest-to-reach areas is essential for finishing the job of polio eradication,' said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. 'These new funds will not only help to drive us towards a polio-free world, but will also help to build more sustainable and resilient health systems to protect the same children and communities who are at risk of polio against the many other health threats they face.' 'Polio eradication is within reach, but the progress is fragile, and we must remain laser focused,' said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. 'This new funding will help ensure that all children get vaccinated to eradicate polio, while strengthening community-based health systems. No child should suffer from an easily preventable disease.' Specifically, the funding partnership is expected to include: **€500 million in new funding for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative **(as outlined above) €500 million in investments and grants to ensure health innovations are more accessible, strengthen health systems and prepare for future pandemics : The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation plans to provide €250 million of grants and investments to match a €250 million in investments made by the European Investment Bank and guaranteed by the European Fund for Sustainable Development plus. €80 million grants for Technical Assistance: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation expects to match €40 million in grants from the European Commission to provide technical assistance and ensure that global health programs achieve their full potential. The partnership announced today builds from existing partnerships between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Commission and Member States, including a €100 million support package for the recently established African Medicines Agency (AMA) and national African medicines regulatory agencies or regional initiatives, the African Health Diagnostics Platform, which supports African partners to increase access and reduce costs of laboratory testing, and coordination on health initiatives such as COVAX , a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

          "fullText": "WHO releases updated guidance on adolescent health and well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) is releasing the second edition of its Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) guidance. The document aims to equip governments to respond to the health and well-being challenges, opportunities and needs of adolescents. The guidance provides the latest available data on adolescent health and well-being. It also outlines an updated list of core indicators that data should be collected on. Globally, road injury was the top cause of death for adolescent males in 2019. Among female adolescents, the leading causes of death were diarrhoeal diseases among the younger group (10-14 years) and tuberculosis (TB) in the older group (15-19 years). Over the last 20 years, mortality rates have declined among adolescents globally, with the largest decline in older (1519 years) adolescent girls. For non-fatal diseases, the burden has not improved over the past two decades, with the main causes of ill health in this category being: mental health conditions (depressive and anxiety disorders, childhood behavioural disorders), iron deficiency anaemia, skin diseases and migraine. Adolescent well-being depends on a range of factors, including healthy food, education, life skills and employability, connectedness, feeling valued by society, safe and supportive environments, resilience, and the freedom to make choices. To take an appropriately holistic approach, the guidance outlines how to take crosscutting action to support adolescent health and well-being, with mutually reinforcing interventions across sectors, such as health, education, social protection, and telecommunications. Targeted efforts are also required to engage adolescents, as they trust health systems less than adults do and are especially vulnerable to modern-day trends, like online bullying and gaming. There has been substantial progress since the launch of the guidance’s first edition in 2017. A range of World Health Assembly resolutions address these issues, spanning areas such as the health workforce, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), emergencies, and water and sanitation. New initiatives have been established, such as the    in 2018 and the Joint Programme on Mental Health and Psychosocial Wellbeing and Development of Children and Adolescents launched by WHO and UNICEF in 2020. “Informed by the AA-HA! guidance, many more governments are investing in comprehensive and evidence-based adolescent health and well-being programmes, developed in close consultation with adolescents and youth,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent and Ageing. “The commitment to collaboration and working closely with young people catalysed by the first edition can be seen in WHO’s strengthened partnerships with other UN agencies and the newly created WHO Youth Council.” This new version of the AA-HA! guidance also includes an updated package of evidence-based interventions and advises governments on how to set national priorities, implement programmes, and conduct monitoring, evaluation and research. Evidence shows that the smartest investments are coordinated investments in health and education that reinforce each other. The second edition is distinct for integrating the concept of well-being, expanding from a largely health-centric to a more holistic approach to adolescents. It also incorporates learnings from both the application of the first edition and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that the role of schools goes well beyond education to providing critical nutrition, social protection, mental health and other services. The guidance also makes the case for investment in adolescent health and wellbeing. An investment of US$ 1 in adolescent well-being brings a return of US$ 5-10, sometimes more, and putting resources into preventing NCDs during adolescence would yield US$ 400 billion in economic benefits over 50 years globally. This guidance was developed by WHO in collaboration with global partners, including UN Women, UNAIDS, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP and PMNCH.",

'Polio eradication is finally within reach, thanks to the tremendous generosity of our partners and their support for the heroic efforts of health workers and community influencers in communities around the world. 'But the progress we have made against the disease is fragile, and we cannot afford to lose focus. 'Millions of children are still missing out on vaccination because of pandemic-related disruptions, conflict, climate disasters, displacement, and increasing vaccine misinformation. 'Most of these children live in the poorest and most marginalized communities with limited access to life saving vaccination and health services. These are also the places where the polio virus continues to thrive and spread. 'The €500 million in funding announced by the partnership today will be critical to our efforts to vaccinate these children against polio. It will also be essential to support the strengthening of community-based health systems for the delivery of more equitable primary health care over the long term. 'Moving forward, we will continue to focus on the timely delivery of vaccines to countries in need that’s over a billion doses of polio vaccines every year. 'And we will also increase our support to community health workers. They are on the frontlines every day, working to vaccinate children, building trust in vaccine efficacy, and engaging with local leaders. 'You can count on UNICEF to remain a steadfast partner in our collective effort to ensure that every child has access to lifesaving vaccines, and lives a life free from polio. 'Thank you.'

          "fullText": "AFGHANISTAN. On 7 October, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck 40km west of Herat City in Herat Province, western Afghanistan. Several aftershocks have occurred since of varying magnitude, with the initial quake felt in neighbouring Badghis and Farah provinces. As of 8 October, reports indicated that 1,023 people have been killed and 1,663 injured in 11 villages of the Zindajan District in Herat Province, where it is estimated that 100 per cent of the homes have been completely destroyed and another 516 people (203 men and 213 women) are reported missing. At least 11,585 people (1,655 families) are reported to have been directly affected by the earthquake across Zindajan (1,320 families), Injil (150 families), Gulran (95 families), Kohsan (60 families) and Kushk (30 families) districts of Herat Province. Assessments are ongoing with casualties and numbers of affected people expected to rise further. PAPUA NEW GUINEA. A series of earthquakes have struck communities in Madang Province and have affected an estimated 25,000 people. On 7 October, an 6.7 magnitude earthquake at a depth of 74 km struck 56 kilometres Southeast of Madang Province. Two substantial aftershocks ensued within 1 hour, measuring 6.9Mat a depth of 71 km, and another registering 5.4M at a depth of 114 km. The earthquakes affected over 150 villages comprising an estimated 25,000 people. The earthquake also inflicted infrastructural damages including on power lines in various areas of Madang, resulting in widespread power outages. Humanitarian partners continue to liaise closely with provincial and national authorities and actors on the ground to monitor the situation closely. MYANMAR. Almost two million people are now displaced across Myanmar including 1.7 million people who have fled their homes as a result of conflict and insecurity since February 2021. On 9 October, dozens of civilians, including internally displaced persons, many of them women and children, were killed and more than 50 were injured in a bombing near the town of Laiza in Kachin State. The explosions affected a village, and an adjacent displacement camp which hosts more than 6,000 people. From 26 September to 1 October, about 4,800 people were newly displaced in the Southeast, while Sagaing and Magway in the Northwest witnessed armed clashes, forcing 13,000 people to flee in late September. The situation is dire in Hpruso Township in Kayah, where fighting has prompted people to seek refuge in forests, where they are in urgent need of shelter, food, and other essential items. People along the Shan-Kayah border continue to face critical shortages of life-saving supplies, with major roads blocked since late September, impeding humanitarian access. Humanitarians continue to respond to emerging needs, reaching at least 1.8 million people during the first half of 2023, including 700,000 displaced people reached. The response remains drastically under-resourced with a mere 28 per cent of required funds received for 2023. Disclaimer",

          "fullText": "Summary. The United Nations Secretary General adopted his Guidance Note on Transitional Justice: A Strategic Tool for People, Prevention and Peace in June 2023. The new Guidance Note is a result of a cross-pillar project under the auspices of Executive Office of the Secretary General and co-leadership of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It followed an extensive consultative process with all relevant United Nations entities and offices. The Guidance Note promotes transitional justice as a pragmatic human rights-based policy tool at the disposal of national stakeholders that is relevant to enhancing peace and security, human rights and accountability, and sustainable development. It aims to achieve greater innovation in the design and implementation of the Organization’s transitional justice work and support to national stakeholders and to contribute to tangible and transformational impact for people and communities. The Guidance Note sets out key features of the United Nations approach to transitional justice: 1 Normative (basing assistance on and promoting compliance with international norms and standards); 2 Strategic (encouraging innovative solutions tailored to the context, fit for purpose, with a holistic and long-term perspective, and coordinated with other reform process); 3 Inclusive (empowering victims, involving the marginalized, adopting a transgenerational and child-sensitive lens, and fostering community ownership); 4 Gender-responsive (adopting and consistently advocating for a gender-responsive approach, including by promoting women’s leadership and addressing the gendered dimension of root causes of violations); and. 5 Transformative (supporting a transformative project that seeks to address structural causes and contributors to conflict and violations and make a tangible difference in people’s lives). Grounded on these key features, the Guidance Note includes recommendations to operationalize the United Nations support to transitional justice, namely to adjust institutional understanding and positioning of transitional justice; to become more innovative in the design and implementation of transitional justice work; and to reinvigorate the victim and people-centeredness of transitional justice, seeking to make an early, tangible and transformational impact for people and communities. The United Nations promotes a holistic approach to transitional justice, understanding the key elements of comprehensive transitional justice processes (truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence) as interrelated. Broad and meaningful consultations throughout the process are critical in informing coherent policies on how the rights and aspirations of people can be satisfied.",

          "fullText": "About this manual. This manual provides NGO security staff with resources to support them in developing and facilitating effective crisis management exercises for strengthening an organization’s crisis response capability. The manual complements other essential GISF resources such as Crisis Management of Critical Incidents, Family First: Liaison and support during a crisis and Managing the Message: Communication and media management in a security crisis which provide guidance on the management of critical incidents. The manual is organized into four sections, each covering a crucial aspect of the exercise development and facilitation process, with practical guidance and useful tools to support each stage of the process. Who is the manual for? The manual is aimed principally at security leads within international development, humanitarian, human rights, and peace and democracy organizations who are looking to facilitate crisis management exercises for other organizations, as part of a peer-to-peer exchange. However, it is equally relevant for those looking to undertake or facilitate exercises within their own organizations. Whether you are new to facilitating crisis management exercises and looking for helpful hints, or seeking ideas to enhance your existing exercises, the manual provides practical guidance and useful insights into the design, preparation, delivery, and learning from crisis management exercises. Introduction. The threats confronting aid workers are rising significantly. The environments in which NGO staff travel and work delivering programs around the world present considerable risks to their security, safety, health and wellbeing. In the face of such threats, organizations have a duty to ensure an effective and timely response to critical incidents and emergency situations involving their staff, wherever they occur. Whilst each incident is unique and requires a tailored response, it is paramount that before an incident occurs, measures and capacities are in place that will enable an organization to effectively manage potential crisis situations. Preparation, through a combination of detailed plans, trained staff, and specialist support, is vital for the successful management of any incident, especially where a coordinated, effective response involving different locations and stakeholders is required. Crisis Management Exercises (CMEs) are an integral component of an organization’s preparedness strategy. Having a plan is not merely enough; organizations also need to ‘learn by doing’. Crisis Management Teams (CMTs) need the opportunity to practice potential responses and test various assumptions to ensure they can coordinate and respond effectively to critical incidents. Learning from exercises, and identifying gaps in plans prior to a real incident, can significantly strengthen an organization’s crisis management capabilities, and ultimately help ensure a more positive outcome.",

          "fullText": "Introduction. Respect for human rights is a critical foundation of strong democratic societies. Yet, while their fundamental importance is universally recognized, human rights continue to be under strain across the world. International and national conflicts, humanitarian crises, rising authoritarianism, racism and xenophobia, climate change, widening inequalities and, most recently, a global pandemic all pose formidable challenges and underscore the need for parliaments to double their efforts to place human rights at the centre of their work. What contribution can parliaments make in this regard? Parliaments have a central role to play in building strong national human rights protection systems by adopting human rights-sensitive laws, by supporting the ratification of human rights treaties, by holding governments to account and by approving national budgets that promote human rights. Parliaments are also well-positioned to work with national and international human rights stakeholders, and to implement, directly and indirectly, international human rights standards, with a full understanding of the local context. Against this backdrop, this self-assessment toolkit sets out to assist parliaments in assessing the extent to which international human rights norms and mechanisms are fully known inside parliament and are integrated into parliamentary processes, procedures and structures. This internal reflection exercise should empower parliaments to identify good practices, gaps and lessons learned, and enable them to chart a course of action to ensure better awareness and mainstreaming of human rights in their work. The publication draws on the extensive experience of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in supporting national parliaments through human rights capacitybuilding activities, and is aligned with the IPU Common Principles for Support to Parliaments, which empower parliaments to take ownership of their own development. It is also intended to complement the joint IPU and OHCHR publication Human Rights: Handbook for Parliamentarians No. 26. The toolkit has been designed to be relevant to all parliaments, irrespective of their political system. In addition, it aims to support parliaments in ensuring that the recommendations of international human rights mechanisms are taken into account in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, given the link between human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The self-assessment is a voluntary exercise and is not intended to rank parliaments. Parliaments do not need to discuss all the questions proposed and they are highly encouraged to tailor the toolkit to fit their national context. Moreover, the effectiveness of the self-assessment derives from parliament’s level of commitment and willingness to reflect on how human rights norms and mechanisms are integrated into parliamentary work, and to take the necessary follow-up action that emerges from this exercise in order to strengthen the protection and promotion of human rights. Therefore, leading and taking part in a self-assessment exercise provides a unique opportunity for parliaments to work together in an inclusive environment to set their human rights goals.",

          "fullText": "Introduction. Le respect des droits humains est un élément essentiel de toute société démocratique forte. Pourtant, si leur importance fondamentale est universellement reconnue, les droits humains continuent à être en proie à des tensions dans le monde entier. Conflits nationaux et internationaux, crises humanitaires, montée de l’autoritarisme, du racisme et de la xénophobie, changements climatiques, aggravation des inégalités et, plus récemment, une pandémie mondiale sont autant d’éléments qui posent des difficultés colossales et qui mettent en exergue la nécessité pour les parlements de redoubler d’efforts afin de placer les droits humains au cur de leur action. Quelle peut-être la contribution des parlements à cet égard ? Ils ont un rôle central à jouer pour ce qui est de créer des systèmes de protection des droits humains robustes en adoptant des lois sensibles aux droits humains, en soutenant la ratification de traités en la matière, en demandant des comptes aux gouvernements et en approuvant des budgets nationaux qui les promeuvent. Ils sont aussi bien placés pour travailler avec des acteurs nationaux et internationaux des droits humains et mettre en uvre, directement ou indirectement, les normes internationales pertinentes, grâce à une compréhension parfaite du contexte local. Dans ce contexte, cet outil d’auto-évaluation vise à aider les parlements à évaluer l’étendue de la connaissance des normes et mécanismes internationaux des droits humains en leur sein et leur degré d’intégration dans les processus, procédures et structures parlementaires. Cet exercice de réflexion interne doit permettre aux parlements de recenser les bonnes pratiques, les lacunes et les leçons tirées et de déterminer la voie à suivre pour veiller à une meilleure compréhension des droits humains et à leur intégration pleine et entière dans les travaux parlementaires. Cette publication s’appuie sur l’expérience considérable de l’Union interparlementaire (UIP) et du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme (HCDH) en ce qui concerne le soutien apporté aux parlements nationaux au moyen d’activités de renforcement des capacités dans le domaine des droits humains. Elle se conforme en outre aux Principes communs en matière d’assistance aux parlements de l’UIP, qui leur donnent le contrôle de leur propre développement. Elle a également vocation à compléter la publication conjointe de l’UIP et du HCDH intitulée Droits de l’homme : Guide à l’usage des parlementaires n 26. Cet outil a été conçu pour être utile à tous les parlements, quel que soit leur système politique. En outre, il vise à les aider à veiller à ce que les recommandations des mécanismes internationaux des droits humains soient prises en considération dans la mise en uvre du Programme de développement durable à l’horizon 2030 (Programme 2030), considérant le lien entre droits humains et Objectifs de développement durable (ODD). Cette auto-évaluation est un exercice volontaire et n’a pas vocation à classer les parlements. Ils n’ont pas à aborder toutes les questions proposées et sont vivement encouragés à adapter l’outil à leur contexte national. Par ailleurs, l’efficacité de l’autoévaluation est tributaire du niveau d’engagement du parlement ainsi que de sa volonté de s’intéresser à la manière dont les normes et les mécanismes des droits humains s’intègrent dans le travail parlementaire et de prendre les mesures nécessaires pour donner suite à ce qui ressort de cet exercice, dans l’optique de renforcer la protection et la promotion des droits humains. Dès lors, mener à bien et prendre part à un exercice d’auto-évaluation offre aux parlements une occasion unique de collaborer dans un environnement inclusif pour fixer leurs objectifs en matière de droits humains.",

          "fullText": "Introducción. El respeto por los derechos humanos es el fundamento esencial de las sociedades democráticas sólidas. Aun así, aunque se reconoce universalmente su importancia fundamental, los derechos humanos continúan estando sometidos a presión en todo el mundo. Los conflictos nacionales e internacionales, las crisis humanitarias, el aumento del autoritarismo, el racismo y la xenofobia, el cambio climático, la expansión de las desigualdades y, más recientemente, la pandemia mundial constituyen desafíos formidables y subrayan la necesidad de que los parlamentos dupliquen sus esfuerzos para situar a los derechos humanos en el centro de su labor. Qué pueden aportar los parlamentos a este respecto? Los parlamentos desempeñan una función central en la construcción de sistemas nacionales sólidos de protección de los derechos humanos adoptando leyes que tengan en cuenta los derechos humanos, respaldando la ratificación de tratados de derechos humanos, exigiendo responsabilidades a los Gobiernos y aprobando presupuestos nacionales que promuevan los derechos humanos. Además, los parlamentos ocupan una posición excelente a la hora de trabajar con las partes interesadas, nacionales e internacionales, en materia de derechos humanos, y de implementar, directa o indirectamente, las normas internacionales de derechos humanos con plena comprensión del contexto local. Con este telón de fondo, la presente herramienta de autoevaluación tiene el propósito de ayudar a los parlamentos a evaluar hasta qué punto los mecanismos y las normas internacionales de derechos humanos son plenamente conocidos dentro del parlamento y están integrados en las estructuras, los procedimientos y los procesos parlamentarios. Este ejercicio interno de reflexión debería empoderar a los parlamentos para que identifiquen buenas prácticas, deficiencias y lecciones aprendidas, además de facilitarles trazar un curso de acción que asegure una mejor comprensión e integración de los derechos humanos en su labor. La presente publicación se fundamenta en la amplia experiencia de la Unión Interparlamentaria (UIP) y la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos (ACNUDH) brindando asistencia a los parlamentos nacionales mediante actividades de desarrollo de la capacidad en materia de derechos humanos, y se encuentra en consonancia con los Principios Comunes en materia de asistencia a los parlamentos de la UIP, los cuales empoderan a los parlamentos para que se transformen en autores de su propio desarrollo. Está concebida también para servir de complemento a la publicación conjunta de la UIP y ACNUDH titulada Derechos Humanos. Manual para Parlamentarios N 26. Esta herramienta ha sido diseñada con el propósito de ser relevante para todos los parlamentos, independientemente de su sistema político. Además, tiene también por objetivo apoyar a los parlamentos a la hora de garantizar que las recomendaciones formuladas por los mecanismos internacionales de derechos humanos se tomen en cuenta en la aplicación de la Agenda 2030 para el Desarrollo Sostenible, dado el vínculo entre los derechos humanos y los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS). La autoevaluación es un ejercicio voluntario que no pretende establecer una clasificación de parlamentos. No es necesario que los parlamentos debatan todas las cuestiones propuestas, sino que más bien se les anima encarecidamente a que adapten la herramienta para que se ajuste a su contexto nacional. Asimismo, la eficacia de la autoevaluación deriva del grado de compromiso del parlamento y de la disposición a reflexionar sobre el modo en que los mecanismos y las normas de derechos humanos se encuentran integrados en la labor parlamentaria, además de la adopción de las medidas de seguimiento necesarias que surjan de este ejercicio, con el fin de fortalecer la protección y promoción de los derechos humanos. Por lo tanto, participar en un ejercicio de autoevaluación y liderarlo constituyen una oportunidad única para que los parlamentos trabajen juntos en un entorno inclusivo de cara a fijar sus objetivos en materia de derechos humanos.",

          "fullText": "Programs focus on achieving gender equality. , the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco, joins humanitarian organizations and countries around the globe in honoring International Day of the Girl on Oct. 11. The day, first held in 2012, was established to promote equal treatment and opportunities for girls and is an acknowledgment by the world that there is a disparity in the way rights of girls and boys are protected and promoted. The United Nations has noted, 'Nearly 1 in 4 girls aged 15-19 globally are not in education, employment or training, compared to 1 in 10 boys. Yet, every day, girls are breaking boundaries and barriers, tackling issues like child marriage, education inequality, violence, climate justice, and inequitable access to health care. Girls are proving they are unstoppable.' Salesian missionaries living and working in more than 130 countries around the globe are focused on achieving gender equality through educational programs targeted specifically for girls. 'Salesians know that it's more difficult for girls to access education, so we are ensuring young girls can go to school and learn the skills for self-sufficiency,' said Father Timothy Ploch, interim director of Salesian Missions. 'Salesian educational centers foster safe learning environments for girls and encourage them to continue to advanced education and skills training so they can become leaders in their families and communities.' To mark International Day of the Girl, Salesian Missions is proud to highlight programs around the globe that empower girls through education and social supports. BOLIVIA. Salesian missionaries offer schools and social development programs across Bolivia to ensure youth have access to education and hope for a brighter future. In Cochabamba, Salesians operate Hogar Maria Auxiliadora, where young girls seek shelter and an education. The long-term residential home provides a safe, structured setting where young girls can grow into independent and self-sufficient young women. As many as 45 girls ages 2-17 live there at any given time. Eden Gordon, a Salesian lay missioner who has served twice at Hogar Maria Auxiliadora, was determined to help one young girl who had been abandoned. Veronica arrived when she was just 6 years old, abandoned by her parents without understanding why. Gordon knew she needed to reassure Veronica of her worth, so she played a daily game with the little girl in the weeks leading up to her move into the residence. Gordon would ask Veronica when she was coming to live at the Hogar and tell her that she was excited and waiting for her arrival. It became a happy game the two played when they spoke. The game instilled such confidence that on the day of her move, Veronica marched in with a big grin on her face. Gordon even nicknamed her Querida, from the Spanish 'to love.' Every time she hears it, Veronica understands its truth. ECUADOR. Salesian missionaries in Machala, Ecuador , provide technical education for at-risk young people from low-income sectors in the city. Salesians also supported 20 small family business initiatives to improve the living conditions of the beneficiaries. The project was supported by the Salesian Mission Office in Madrid, the ADEY Foundation and the Our Lady of Mercy Parish in Ecuador. The goal was to reduce poverty by strengthening technical skills and promoting family and entrepreneurship for young people ages 18-35. Courses focused mostly on young women who are migrants, mainly from Venezuela, and Ecuadorian citizens experiencing social exclusion, including single mothers and economically dependent women. With lower levels of education, these young women face the greatest barriers to accessing training and employment. Education included courses in gastronomy, cosmetics and cell phone repair, which were held at three different times. Each course included 108 hours of face-to-face lectures on technical topics, 12 hours of lectures on peace culture, entrepreneurship and business models, and 24 hours of hands-on individual work that was done at home. A total of 218 students participated in the courses, with 68% of the students women and 32% men. Of the students, 56% were from Ecuador and 44% were migrants. PAKISTAN. Salesian missionaries provide social development and educational services to poor youth and their families in centers in Lahore and Quetta, Pakistan. Salesian schools provide economic benefits, scholarships and accommodations for students from the poorest families so that education is not only accessible but also an incentive for parents to send their children to school. Salesians provide training programs focused on educating girls and young women about their rights with the aim of creating and spreading awareness and self-determination. Salesians encourage girls and young women to continue their studies. They also organize courses to impart knowledge and skills aimed at learning a trade. One of the students said, 'If we study, we can have a brighter future.' Salesian school fees are very low, since most families have one income to support many children. Scholarships are needed so that students can complete their education and skills training in order to become independent members of society. One of the educational facilities is the Don Bosco Learning Center, within the Don Bosco Quetta community. The center has been teaching primary and secondary school in Quetta since 2000. More than 780 students, ages 8-22, attend this center. Students also have access to a computer lab to learn technology skills in order to compete in the current labor market. SIERRA LEONE. St. Augustine Agricultural Junior Secondary School, located in Lungi, Sierra Leone , received support from donor funding from Salesian Missions. The school, which was established in 1984, has 14 classrooms, a computer lab, an infirmary/clinic and an administrative building. The school provides education to marginalized students in the region. It currently has 700 students, 34 teachers and four auxiliary staff, including a nurse. Given the economic condition of the country and the challenges faced by students, the school recently reintroduced its feeding program. A portion of the donor funding went to support this program and ensure students in need have access to healthy nutrition through school lunch. In addition, funding provided for school uniforms and to support salaries for the auxiliary staff. Maintenance and repairs of the school buildings, assembly and sport grounds, school fence, bathrooms and canteen also took place with the funding. At the school, Salesian sports programming provides much-needed recreation and life skills for the students. Funding provided for table tennis equipment, balls, and jerseys for soccer, basketball and volleyball.

          "fullText": "Joint Press Release. MANILA, 10 Oct. 2023 Ahead of the International Day of the Girl Child, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in partnership with the Australian Government, the United Nations Children’s Funds (UNICEF), the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and the University of San Carlos - Office of Population Studies (USC-OPS), launched the Phase III implementation of the Longitudinal Cohort Study on the Filipino Child. This unique study tracked the development of Filipino children over 15 years. It followed the same group of 5,000 children from age 10 in 2016 until the end of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2030. “This [launch] and this study is a timely reminder of the importance of investing in the health, education, and well-being of adolescent girls,” said UNFPA Country Representative Dr. Leila Joudane. “We are at that crucial point in time when the children covered by the study are going through the tumultuous and crucial period of adolescence, when they develop knowledge and skills, learn to manage emotions and relationships, and acquire abilities that will be important for them as they become productive members of society.” Thanh Le PSM, the Australian Embassy’s Development Counsellor, emphasised the importance of the greater dissemination of the study’s findings to help inform policymakers address the needs of Filipino children and girls. “This study will help put girls at the centre of decision-making efforts, which aligns with Australia’s International Development Policy that also prioritises addressing gender equality. And so Australia is pleased to announce our continued support for a third phase of the Filipino child Cohort Study.” “As we launch the third phase of the Longitudinal Cohort Study on the Filipino Child and celebrate the International Day of the Girl Child, we remember all the girls who are still unable to complete their education, access comprehensive health and nutrition services, and live free from gender-based violence and harmful practices. As girls call for change, we must move beyond reaffirming commitments and make bold investments for their rights”, UNICEF Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov said. During the launch, researchers from USC-OPS shared key findings from the study. They pointed out that girls fared better during the first six years of the study for example: During their earlier years, teenage boys are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as smoking and drinking alcohol than teenage girls. At age 13 to 14, 7.7% of boys have tried smoking, compared to only 2.5% of girls. Similarly, 21.8% of boys have tried drinking alcohol, compared to 12.8% of girls. In terms of education, at age 16, girls are more likely to be on track with their schooling than boys (85% of girls vs. 75% of boys). This means more girls were in age-appropriate grades, were not delayed or repeated a school year. The researchers noted, however, that the study also shows the unique challenges related to gender norms and stereotypes that could significantly impact the futures of girls. Data gathered at age 15 to 16 of the respondents showed that 2.6% of the girls have already experienced early pregnancy while 3% are already cohabiting or living with their partners, compared to only 1% of the boys. And while the majority are asked to perform household chores, unequal gender norms or stereotypes are observed as girls spend more time (40% more) on such tasks when compared to boys. This might mean they have less time for studying or rest. “We already know from other national studies that women are less likely to be able to participate economically and in decision-making during adulthood. Our cohort study aims to learn why this happens and what factors contribute to girls losing their edge as they reach adulthood. We are hopeful that the study will generate insights that will help stakeholders provide solutions and enable women to realize their full potential,” said one of the study’s researchers Dr. Nanette Lee-Mayol, Director of the University of San Carlos - Office of the Population Studies Foundation, Inc. As the sexual and reproductive health agency of the United Nations, UNFPA pointed out that ensuring that adolescent girls “have access to comprehensive sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health services will benefit not just their adult life but also our society and the next generation of children.” Joudane said the challenge for them now is to work closely with the government and other development partners to use the rich data and information from the study to reduce the structural barriers to services for adolescents and to address factors that cause high rates of adolescent pregnancy, child marriage, mental health disorders and violence against girls.

          "fullText": "The Tunisian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release six political opposition figures who have been arbitrarily detained for nearly eight months solely for their peaceful political activism on unfounded accusations of “conspiracy against state security” and drop all charges against them and others facing similar charges, said Amnesty International. The six detainees include opposition activist Jaouhar Ben Mbarek, politician Khayam Turki, dissident and politician Abdelhamid Jlassi, opposition activist Issam Chebbi, and the lawyers Ghazi Chaouachi and Ridha Bel Hadj. All had been held under an initial pre-trial detention order of six months which was renewed by the investigative judge after it expired on 22 August. Last week, Ben Mbarek announced a hunger strike to denounce his arbitrary detention. Prominent human rights lawyer Ayachi Hammami, who is being investigated in the same case for similar accusations as his detained clients, was summoned to attend interrogation by the investigative judge this morning 10 October in a signal that authorities have renewed their efforts to pursue this case. “The Tunisian authorities have carried out a political witch-hunt rounding up opposition figures and misusing the judicial system to suppress the right to freedom of expression and crackdown on political dissent They have for seven months thrown opposition politicians and dissident activists in prolonged pre-trial detention which should be reserved for exceptional cases, not wielded as a weapon against peaceful activists. The continued arbitrary detention of the six political detainees is a travesty and must stop,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Director for the Middle East and North Africa. On 2 October, Tunisian authorities also brought criminal charges against two of the detainees’ lawyers in two separate legal cases. “The growing crackdown and judicial harassment of lawyers caught up in this case is one of the deeply disturbing features of the past months. Instead of opening new investigations against the lawyers of people arbitrarily detained, Tunisian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release all the defendants and immediately drop the unfounded charges and accusations against them. This is a politically motivated case that must end along with the authorities’ impunity and shameful campaign of repression,” said Heba Morayef. Hammami’s interrogation follows that of Mohamed Hamdi, Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, Riadh Chaibi, Noureddine Bhiri, and other opposition political activists who are being investigated in this case, indicating that the judge may have now investigated almost all defendants which would allow him to decide on an indictment. Defense lawyers have appealed against the pre-trial detention orders and filed multiple requests for provisional release, but the investigative judge repeatedly refused the requests. Prosecution of opposition leaders and their lawyers. On 2 October, the Tunis Court of First Instance general prosecutor referred Lawyers Islem Hamza and Dalila Ben Mbarek Msaddak for investigation after they made statements to the media on 28 and on 29 September respectively. During a radio interview Hamza said that the charges against her clients were fabricated and that the aim of the investigation was to silence political opposition. Also, during a radio interview, Msaddak explained the lawyers’ request to subpoena the testimonies of foreign diplomats with whom detainees are accused of having exchanged intelligence. They are being investigated in connection with charges under Decree law 54 and Law 63 of 2004 on Protection of Personal Data and risk heavy prison sentences if convicted. The defence team of the detainees is composed of seven lawyers, three of which have been targeted by criminal investigations in relation to their peaceful expression about this case. Islem Hamza had already been referred for investigation under decree law 54 on 14 June 2023 in relation to a media statement she made in her capacity as a defence lawyer, criticizing the transportation conditions of the detainees to and from the prison. Another lawyer, also member of the defence committee of the detainees in the conspiracy case, appeared before the investigative judge on 1 June under charges of “offending others through telecommunications networks “according to Article 86 of the telecommunications code and “accusing a public official of illegal acts without proof” for his intervention during a press conference of the defence committee on 15 May 2023 in which he said that there were discrepancies in the case file noticed by the lawyers which indicated evidence of tampering with the case. “The very essence of justice is undermined when legal professionals are deterred from fulfilling their duties by fear of reprisals or punished merely for advocating their clients’ rights. Authorities must not act in reprisal against lawyers for exercising their legitimate duties and their right to freedom of expression,” said Heba Morayef. Background. Since February 2023, Tunisian authorities have opened criminal investigations against at least 40 people on unfounded accusations in relation to trumped up charges of conspiracy that Amnesty International has deemed to be unfounded. The investigations fall under 10 provisions of the Tunisian Penal Code including Article 72, which mandates the death penalty for trying to “change the nature of the state.” They also face several charges under a dozen articles of the 2015 counterterrorism law including Article 32, which mandates up to 20 years of imprisonment for “forming a terrorist organization”. Between 12 and 23 February eight members of the opposition were arrested and detained under this investigation. Amongst them were opposition political activist and leader in the opposition political group Salvation Front Chaima Issa and lawyer and political activist Lazhar Akermi. After nearly five months of detention, Chaima Issa and Lazhar Akermi were provisionally released on 13 July 2023. However, at least six of their co-defendants remain in prolonged pre-trial arbitrary detention in relation to this investigation. They are politician Khayam Turki; dissident and politician Abdelhamid Jelassi; opposition activist Issam Chebbi; opposition activist Jaouhar Ben Mbarek; and finally, lawyers and opposition activists Ghazi Chaouachi and Ridha Belhaj.",

          "fullText": "Between 5 and 9 September, immigration detainees in Poland’s Przemysl detention centre (Guarded Centre for Aliens) held a hunger strike against “arbitrary detention” and their prolonged detention in the centre. Taking place against a backdrop of growing anti-migrant rhetoric in the run up to the country’s October elections and referendum, this was the largest collective hunger strike to-date. According to Grupa Granica , an organisation which assists migrants in Poland, up to 70 people participated in the strike at the centre, which has a detainee population of 100. Amongst their demands , strikers called for access to healthcare, ability to connect with friends and family through social media, and a guarantee that detainees’ rights will be respected. In particular, they called for an end to lengthy detention periods. As one detainee explained to Balkan Insight , detainees in the centre have no idea when they will leave the centre. “Even criminals in prisons know when they will be released,” he said. The strike reportedly ended soon after masked men stormed into cells within the centre on 8 September, and beat detainees with sticks. Since 2021, the numbers of migrants and asylum seekers entering Poland has increased, largely due to significant numbers of arrivals entering from Belarus. Many are pushed back into Belarus, while most of those who successfully reach Poland are arrested and detained. According to the Polish Border Guard , by the end of August some 19,000 people had attempted to enter Poland from Belarus this year, compared to 16,000 throughout 2022. According to Grupa Granica, 1,008 foreigners were placed in immigration detention during the first half of 2023. The country’s ruling party, the Law and Justice Party (PiS), has responded with discriminatory and belligerent language focused on the “defence” of the eastern border from “illegal migrants.” In an attempt to legitimise these policies, on 15 October PiS will hold a referendum (on the same day as the national elections) which includes questions regarding the country’s migrant and refugee policy. Two of the referendum’s four    are: “Do you support the removal of the barrier on the border between the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Belarus?” “Do you support the admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, in accordance with the forced relocation mechanism imposed by European bureaucracy?” The referendum has been extensively criticised by rights groups. According to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights , the explanatory annex contains deliberately leading information, which “directly suggests the ‘correct’ way to vote. Information spots contain false, simplified information, use rhetorical and emotional manipulations and intentionally create a sense of threat in the recipient.” The group adds: “Human rights, including the rights of migrants and refugees, are fundamental and inalienable rights of every individual, and their protection should not be left to a politically motivated, populist referendum.”",

          "fullText": "Ahead of a hearing at the General Court of the European Union, in which Frontex, the EU border agency, will be questioned over its lack of transparency in relation to its involvement in maritime interceptions and subsequent human rights abuses against refugees and migrants in Libya, Matteo de Bellis, Amnesty International’s Refugee Rights Researcher, said: “Frontex uses planes and drones to spot any people trying to reach safety in Europe by crossing the Mediterranean, before then alerting the Libyan coastguards. As a results, refugees and migrants are routinely intercepted by Libyan coastguards and returned to Libya, where they face arbitrary detention and torture on a mass scale.”    Matteo de Bellis. “Frontex must be transparent about its role in any operations that may have led to human rights violations against refugees and migrants. Without such transparency, any pledges the agency makes regarding human rights protections will be tokenistic and will not lead to the positive changes that the agency promises.” Amnesty International will attend the hearing in Luxembourg to observe proceedings and support efforts to advance justice for refugees and migrants in the central Mediterranean. Background. On 11 October 2023, at 14:30 CEST, the General Court of the European Union will hold a hearing on the case Naass and Sea-Watch v Frontex . The case focuses on Frontex’s refusal to disclose documents relating to its surveillance activities in the central Mediterranean on 30 July 2021, when the Libyan Coast Guard intercepted about 20 people in the Maltese Search-and-Rescue Region and returned them to Libya. Sea-Watch, which was operating Seabird 1, an aircraft, and Sea-Watch 3, a rescue vessel, witnessed the operation and subsequently investigated the incident, together with other organizations. Sea-Watch, assisted by the NGO FragDenStaat, asked Frontex to disclose documents detailing its aerial operations and its cooperation with Italian, Maltese and Libyan authorities. Frontex refused to disclose the documents and Sea-Watch filed a lawsuit against Frontex in April 2022 before the General Court of the EU.",

Dear Excellencies, We, the undersigned individuals and organizations, are writing regarding the currently under your consideration.",
          "fullText": "To Permanent Representatives of Member and Observer States of the United Nations. Re: Joint Call to Advance Gender Justice in the Draft Crimes Against Humanity Convention. Dear Excellencies, We, the undersigned individuals and organizations, are writing regarding the currently under your consideration. We applaud the Sixth Committee’s leadership on and engagement with the draft articles. April’s resumed session discussion was an indisputable advance. Progress is being made to form the basis for actual negotiations of a new crimes against humanity convention that would have significant potential to advance protection for civilian populations at risk as well as justice for gender-based crimes. The current draft draws its definitional language from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The statute was an important step forward in the codification of atrocity crimes, including its explicit recognition of a range of sexual and gender-based crimes beyond rape. However, in the 25 years since the Rome Statute’s adoption, there has been significant progress in our understanding of sexual and gender-based crimes and notions of gender, and a new international treaty on crimes against humanity must reflect that progress. Indeed, the ILC itself noted that its objective in drafting the articles was not “codification of existing law,” but rather, to draft “provisions that would be both effective and likely acceptable to States, based on provisions often used in widely adhered-to treaties addressing crimes, as a basis for a possible future convention.” In that vein, we support the ILC’s decision to exclude the Rome Statute’s definition of ‘gender’ from the draft articles in recognition of “developments in international human rights law and international criminal law” that reflect “the current understanding as to the meaning of the term ‘gender.’” As States consider the draft articles, we urge you to approach the development of a new crimes against humanity treaty with a gender-competent, survivor-centric, and intersectional lens. Such an approach would involve ensuring the inclusion of a non-discrimination provision anchoring the obligation to apply and interpret the treaty’s provisions consistent with internationally recognized human rights law and without adverse distinction on grounds including race, gender, age, disability, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status. Relatedly, any wording which results in the exclusion or minimization of legal protection should be avoided. In particular, as you consider your own substantive positions on the treaty, including for submission of written comments by December 1, 2023, and in advance of the Sixth Committee’s second resumed session in April 2024, we urge you to consider issues relating to strengthening the gender-progressive, survivor-centric, and intersectional nature of the draft articles, which may include: Improving the reproductive violence provisions by revising the definition of sexual violence to include reproductive violence, eliminating the unnecessary sentence in the definition of forced pregnancy that references national abortion laws, and using gender-inclusive language in the definition of forced pregnancy; Including the slave trade as an enumerated provision; Codifying gender apartheid as an international crime by adding gender as a basis for the crime against humanity of apartheid, in direct response to from women’s civil society; Including forced marriage as a specifically enumerated crime against humanity and adopting a clear definition rooted in the significant international case law to date, to reflect the development of international criminal law on this offense; and; Ensuring provisions on victim/survivor participation and rights are robust, including a broad and unambiguous definition of ‘victim’ and expanding reparations provisions, and reflect input from affected communities. Each of these points have been developed further by groups of international legal subject-matter experts, for your benefit and consideration. Links to those briefs are included in the footnotes to the relevant topic, other than the victim/survivor brief, which is in a consultation process with victim/survivor groups and remains forthcoming. Please note that each brief reflects the views of the authors and signatories only of that brief. A strong, gender-progressive crimes against humanity convention would also provide for a treaty body monitoring mechanism to promote implementation of the treaty, advance progressive interpretations of the text, and monitor progress on gender justice under the treaty. States could draw from the monitoring bodies established under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, treaties which are similarly geared toward preventing and punishing specific conduct. While there are numerous opportunities for States to press for more gender-progressive provisions in the text of the draft articles, it is equally essential that the treaty-making process itself is inclusive. States must ensure robust participation by women and gender minorities in the delegations in all stages of the treaty- development process, including drafting, design, negotiation, implementation, and monitoring of the convention. It is equally important that survivors of crimes against humanity are part of the treaty-making process, partaking in decisions that impact them, and ensuring that survivors’ voices are adequately represented in the final provisions of the treaty. Given this unique and powerful opportunity to combat impunity and codify progressive standards of international law, we urge States to adopt a gender-competent, survivor-centric, and intersectional lens and reflect the progress made and lessons learned in the 25 years since the Rome Statute was adopted.

All times are local (unless otherwise noted) Masaya is a broad, 6 x 11 km caldera with steep-sided walls up to 300 m high located about 20 km SE of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. Eruptions have originated from the Nindirí and Masaya cones, which were constructed at the southern end of the fracture system and contain multiple summit craters, including the currently active Santiago crater. The Santiago crater contains a small lava lake that emits weak gas-and-steam plumes. The current eruption period began in October 2015 and more recently has consisted of weak thermal activity and gas-and-steam emissions (BGVN 47:08). This report updates activity from August 2022 through January 2023, characterized by continued thermal activity, seismicity, and sulfur dioxide emissions, based on Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) monthly reports and satellite data. Thermal activity has been relatively consistent over the past two years, according to the MIROVA (Middle InfraRed Observation of Volcanic Activity) graph (figure 107). An analysis of MODIS satellite data showed 15 low-power thermal hotspots during the reporting period: twice in mid-August 2022, twice in early November 2022, five times in December 2022, and six times in January 2023. Sentinel-2 infrared satellite images showed an occasional hotspot in the Santiago crater’s lava lake throughout the reporting period (figure 108). Intermittent small sulfur dioxide plumes drifted generally W on 16-17, 23, and 29 August, 2, 7-9, 18-19, 23, and 29 September, 4, 15, 21, 25-26, and 30 October, 1, 5-6, 10-12, and 26-27 November, and 29-30 January 2023, based on data from the TROPOMI instrument on the Sentinel-5P satellite.",

          "fullText": "WMO hosted an international workshop on the development of a comprehensive integrated global observing system that would support the implementation of the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch (GGGW). The Global Greenhouse Gas Watch was approved by the World Meteorological Congress in May 2023 in view of the increasing urgency of climate change mitigation. It aims to fill critical information gaps and provide an integrated, operational framework which brings under one roof all space-based and surface-based observing systems, as well as modelling and data assimilation capabilities. Most of the existing international and national activities are currently undertaken by the research community and supported by research funding. At present, there is no comprehensive, routine and timely international exchange of surface and space-based greenhouse gas observations or modelling products. The three-day workshop “Observations within the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch,” brought together more than 200 experts from the public and private sectors and academia on 3-5 October. “Many of the participants highlighted WMO’s long-standing World Weather Watch as a model to follow, and the participants were particularly interested in the opportunity to significantly strengthen the greenhouse gas observing networks both on land and over the ocean through international coordination,” said Lars Peter Riishojgaard, Deputy Director of WMO Infrastructure Department. “The engagement of so many internationally recognized scientists as well as some of the world’s premier global greenhouse gas flux estimation capabilities in the planning of the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch is extremely encouraging. The community clearly recognizes the role of strengthened international collaboration and coordination in enabling it to provide a stronger and more clearly articulated message to the UNFCCC Parties and other stakeholders,” he said. The workshop on 3-5 October on “Observations within the Global Greenhouse Gas Watch” issued recommendations regarding the design of the integrated observing system, gap analysis of the existing capabilities and recommendations on the ways to leverage those, and prioritization of the actions for implementation. Topics addressed included: Taking stock of the existing observing systems for atmospheric, ocean and biosphere measurements of greenhouse gases and their fluxes from ground/earth surface and space, Integration of observations from different platforms within each domain and across Earth System domains, Common approaches to Quality Assurance and Quality control including calibration and uncertainty characterization, Metadata standards, International data exchange, Needs for capacity development in observations, Sustainability of the observing system. The Global Greenhouse Gas Watch builds on WMO’s experience in coordinating international collaboration in weather prediction and climate analysis and on long-standing activities in greenhouse gas monitoring and research under the auspices of the Global Atmosphere Watch established in 1989 and its Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System. A series of stakeholder meetings have taken place as momentum builds. The EU-funded Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), implemented by ECMWF, hosted a meeting last month to bring different organisations involved in monitoring greenhouse gases together and to develop common standards for exchanging data and comparing products. Thus, data from different organisations, such as ECMWF/CAMS, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Chinese Meteorological Administration will have to be made comparable. “CAMS is an active player in this field as it monitors and forecasts global levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations as well as net fluxes of those gases into the atmosphere,” says the Director of CAMS, Vincent-Henri Peuch. “So we’ll have a role to play in the WMO initiative.”",

          "fullText": "What happened, where and when? Bolivia is currently facing a severe crisis due to a combination of intense winter heat fueled by the climate crisis and the El Niño phenomenon. Large portions of the country are experiencing drought, water shortages, and rising average temperatures. Local authorities have issued stark warnings, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation during what has turned out to be the hottest winter ever recorded in the country. Temperatures have skyrocketed to a scorching 40C. Notably, on 25 September, Bolivia recorded its highest-ever September temperature, reaching 40.3C. In the weeks ahead, some regions are expected to experience even more extreme temperatures, potentially reaching as high as 45C. By December, there is a “high probability” Bolivia’s iconic Lake Titicaca will be 64cm below the drought alert level, breaking a low water record set in 1998 by 33cm (1). The Bolivian Drought Monitor reveals that all of the country's Macroregions, which are spatial monitoring units with similar climatic characteristics, are witnessing areas affected by drought. However, as indicated in Map 2, the Macroregions Altiplano (3,200 to 5,000 masl), Valles (1,500 to 3,000 masl), Yungas-Chapare (150 to 4,200 masl), and Chaco (279 to 2,000 masl) are the most severely impacted, experiencing significant soil moisture loss and displaying areas of moderate to extreme drought (2). At the departmental level, the drought is most severely affecting seven out of Bolivia's nine departments: La Paz, Potosí, Cochabamba, Oruro, Chuquisaca, Tarija and Santa Cruz. In four of these departments - Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Oruro, and Potosí - the Departmental Emergency Operations Centers (COED) have recommended the declaration of a state of emergency. Consequently, on 29 September, the Departmental Autonomous Government of Oruro promulgated Departmental Decree No. 235, titled 'Declaration of Departmental Disaster due to Adverse Drought Event in Oruro Municipalities,' in response to the drought's impact on over 200 communities (3). Similarly, on 21 September, the Departmental Autonomous Government of Cochabamba, through Decree No. 5585, declared a Departmental State of Emergency due to the ongoing drought situation. They called upon Municipal Autonomous Governments, Indigenous Peasant Farmers of Cochabamba, and the general public to use water responsibly for both irrigation and human consumption. Additionally, they urged everyone to take preventive and preparatory measures in anticipation of potential adverse events, emergencies, or disasters resulting from the current conditions. Notably, the recorded rainfall in municipalities has been the lowest since 1950, measuring less than 200 millimeters (4). On 14 September, the Autonomous Departmental Government of Chuquisaca declared a Departmental Emergency due to Meteorological (Frost) and Climatological (Drought) Threats via Departmental Decree No. 034. At the time of this departmental decree, 14 municipalities had already declared a State of Municipal Emergency, affecting over 68,690 families in the department (5).

          "fullText": "Joint media release with The Hon Pat Conroy MP, Minister for International Development and the Pacific; The Hon Tim Watts MP, Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs. 11 October 2023. The Australian Government will provide $1 million to support the people of Afghanistan following the deadly earthquake which struck Herat Province. The earthquake has exacerbated the dire humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, where 29.2 million people are already in desperate need. Australia’s assistance will be directed through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF), led by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The AHF provides emergency shelter, health, food and protection for vulnerable people. No Australian funding will benefit or legitimise the Taliban regime. Australia has already committed $50 million in 2023-24 to the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan. Quotes attributable to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Penny Wong: “We are deeply troubled by the loss of life and destruction in Afghanistan. “Australia’s support will be delivered through independent agencies to provide basic needs such as shelter, food and medicine. “Australia stands with the people of Afghanistan.” Quotes attributable to Minister for International Development and the Pacific, The Hon Pat Conroy MP: “This earthquake has exacerbated the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, where almost 30 million people are already in desperate need. “We are working closely with our humanitarian partners who have initiated relief efforts, deploying medical and trauma support to regional hospitals, as well as providing emergency shelter, supplies and food assistance to affected areas.” Quotes attributable to the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Tim Watts (MP): “Our thoughts are with the victims of this tragic earthquake, their families, and the rescue personnel. “We urge the Taliban to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of the people of Afghanistan, especially women and girls, ethnic and religious minorities.” Media enquiries Minister's office: (02) 6277 7500; DFAT Media Liaison: (02) 6261 1555",

          "fullText": "Section 2 TROPICAL CYCLONE OVERVIEW FOR 2022. 2.1 Review of tropical cyclones in 2022. **2.1.1 Tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific (including the South China Sea) ** In 2022, a total of 27 tropical cyclones occurred over the western North Pacific (WNP) and the South China Sea (SCS) bounded by the Equator, 45N, 100E and 180, less than the long-term (1961 - 2020) average figure of around 30. During the year, 11 of the tropical cyclones attained typhoon intensity or above, less than the long-term average (1961 - 2020) of about 15, with four of them reaching super typhoon intensity (maximum 10-minute wind speed of 185 km/h or above near the centre). Figure 2.1 shows the monthly frequencies of the occurrence of tropical cyclones in WNP and SCS in 2022. During the year, six tropical cyclones made landfall over China, with two of them crossing the south China coast within 300 km of Hong Kong. Three traversed the Philippines and three made landfall over Vietnam. With an estimated maximum sustained wind speed of 230 km/h and a minimum sea-level pressure of 910 hPa near the centre (Table 4.1), Super Typhoon Hinnamnor (2211) in August to September (Figure 2.3) was the most intense tropical cyclone over the WNP and the SCS in 2022. 2.1.2 Tropical cyclones in Hong Kong’s area of responsibility. Amongst the 27 tropical cyclones in 2022, 13 of them occurred inside Hong Kong’s area of responsibility (i.e. the area bounded by 10N, 30N, 105E and 125E), slightly more than the longterm annual average (1961-2020) figure of around 16 (Table 2.1). Five of them developed within Hong Kong’s area of responsibility. Altogether, 318 tropical cyclone warnings to ships and vessels were issued by the Hong Kong Observatory this year (Table 4.2). 2.1.3 Tropical cyclones over the South China Sea. Nine tropical cyclones affected SCS bounded by 10N, 25N, 105E and 120E in 2022, less than the long-term annual average (1961-2020) of around 12. Four of them formed over the SCS. 2.1.4 Tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong. In 2022, the typhoon season in Hong Kong started on 29 June when Tropical Depression Chaba (2203) formed over the central part of the SCS, necessitating the issuance of the Standby Signal No. 1. The typhoon season ended with the cancellation of all tropical cyclone warning signals on 3 November when Tropical Depression Nalgae (2222) weakened and moved inland after making landfall over Zhuhai.Six tropical cyclones affected Hong Kong during 2022 (Figure 2.2), on par with the long-term (1961-2020) average of about six in a year (Table 2.2). They were Typhoon Chaba (2203) in June to July, Tropical Depression, Tropical Storm Mulan (2207) and Typhoon Ma-on (2209) in August, Typhoon Nesat (2220) in October, and Severe Tropical Storm Nalgae (2222) in October to November. The No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal was issued during the passage of Chaba, Ma-on and Nalgae on 1 July, 24 August and 2 November respectively, the highest tropical cyclone warning signal issued in 2022. The No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal issued during the passage of Chaba was the first time on the HKSAR Establishment Day. Nalgae was the third tropical cyclone necessitating the issuance of the No. 8 Signal in November since 1946. The No. 3 Strong Wind Signal was issued during the passage of Mulan and Nesat. The Tropical Depression necessitated the issuance of the Standby Signal No. 1 in Hong Kong. 2.1.5 Tropical cyclone rainfall. Tropical cyclone rainfall for Hong Kong (total rainfall recorded at the Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters from the time when a tropical cyclone comes within 600 km of Hong Kong to 72 hours after it has dissipated or moved more than 600 km away from Hong Kong) in 2022 was 697.4 mm (Table 4.8.1). This accounted for approximately 31.6% of the year’s total rainfall of 2205.4 mm and slightly less than the 1961-2020 long-term average of 704.2 mm. According to the above definition, Tropical Storm Mulan (2207) brought 206.5 mm of rainfall to Hong Kong (Table 4.8.1) and was the wettest tropical cyclone in 2022.",

Situation des droits de l’homme en Afghanistan. Note du Secrétaire général. Le Secrétaire général a l’honneur de transmettre à l’Assemblée générale le rapport du Rapporteur spécial sur la situation des droits de l’homme en Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, en application de la résolution 51/20 du Conseil des droits de l’homme. Résumé. Le présent rapport, soumis par le Rapporteur spécial sur la situation des droits de l’homme en Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, s’inscrit dans le prolongement de son rapport précédent et traite des faits nouveaux survenus principalement de février à août 2023. I. Introduction. 1. Le présent rapport, soumis conformément à la résolution 51/20 du Conseil des droits de l’homme, donne un aperçu de l’évolution de la situation des droits humains en Afghanistan, principalement entre février et août 2023. Il s’appuie sur le rapport du Rapporteur spécial présenté à l’Assemblée générale à sa soixante-dix-septième session ( A/77/552 ), ainsi que sur ses rapports au Conseil des droits de l’homme. 2. À ce jour, le Rapporteur spécial a effectué trois missions en Afghanistan depuis qu’il a pris ses fonctions en mai 2022, dont une mission conjointe avec la Présidente du Groupe de travail sur la discrimination à l’égard des femmes et des filles en avril et mai 2023. 3. Au cours de ces missions, le Rapporteur spécial s’est rendu dans les provinces de Kaboul, de Mazar-e Charif, de Kandahar, de Bamyan et du Panjchir. Il a rencontré de nombreuses parties prenantes et a été reçu par des hauts fonctionnaires de facto, notamment les vice-premiers ministres par intérim, des ministres et des hauts fonctionnaires au niveau provincial. Le Rapporteur spécial remercie les autorités de facto pour leur coopération dans le cadre de son mandat, y compris pour leurs contributions écrites à ses communications et rapports. 4. Le Rapporteur spécial a également eu des interactions régulières avec un large éventail de parties prenantes à l’extérieur du pays, en participant à des manifestations en personne et en ligne. II. Contexte. 5. Depuis que les Taliban ont pris le pouvoir en août 2021, la situation des droits humains en Afghanistan n’a cessé de se détériorer. Si un large éventail de droits ont été restreints ou violés par les autorités de facto, le cas le plus frappant est la restriction extrême des droits des femmes et des filles. Les autorités de facto ont adopté de nombreux décrets et directives qui privent les femmes et les filles de leurs droits fondamentaux, notamment le droit à l’éducation, au travail, à la liberté de circulation et à la participation à la vie politique et publique. Elles ont notamment interdit aux femmes afghanes de travailler pour des organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) en décembre 2022 et pour l’ONU en avril 2023, ce qui pèse sur les opérations humanitaires dans tout le pays. D’autres droits et libertés fondamentaux, notamment la liberté d’expression, d’opinion et de réunion, les droits à la vie, à l’intégrité physique et à l’accès à la justice, et les droits des minorités sont systématiquement violés, portant préjudice à l’ensemble de la population. L’espace civique continue de se rétrécir et les militantes et militants de la société civile, les journalistes et les manifestantes et manifestants pacifiques continuent de faire l’objet d’arrestations et de détentions arbitraires et de mauvais traitements. Le 13 novembre 2022, les autorités de facto ont annoncé le rétablissement des peines de qisas (loi du talion) et de houdoud (crimes contre Dieu), ce qui signifie que la peine de mort en public est de nouveau en vigueur, ainsi que d’autres peines inhumaines et dégradantes. Selon la Mission d’assistance des Nations Unies en Afghanistan (MANUA), un nombre important de personnes ont été soumis à la flagellation publique, dont 74 hommes, 58 femmes et 2 garçons entre novembre 2022 et avril 2023. 6. Les Taliban affirment non seulement que leurs politiques sont nécessaires pour se conformer à la charia, mais aussi qu’elles sont populaires auprès des Afghans vivant dans le pays. Cette affirmation est vigoureusement réfutée par d’autres Afghans qui résistent au pouvoir des Taliban. La négation constante des droits des femmes nuit sans aucun doute à la popularité des Taliban au niveau local. Elle crée également des obstacles majeurs à toute démarche de reconnaissance par la communauté internationale. 7. Les autorités de facto n’ont pas mis en place une équipe dirigeante qui inclue les femmes et tous les groupes ethniques et religieux. Le gouvernement de facto reste entièrement composé d’hommes, principalement du groupe ethnique des Pachtounes. Le chef des Taliban, Haibatullah Akhundzada, semble resserrer son emprise dire cte sur les affaires de l’État, notamment sur les secteurs de la sécurité et du renseignement, et le remaniement des administrations de la justice, de la sécurité et de la fonction publique, en particulier au niveau infranational, est devenu plus fréquent. Il a également déplacé le bureau du porte-parole des autorités de facto de Kaboul à Kandahar et créé des conseils religieux dotés d’un pouvoir de décision dans plus de 20 provinces. 8. On estime que 85 % des Afghanes et Afghans vivent en dessous du seuil de pauvreté et la fourniture de l’aide humanitaire est mise à rude épreuve. Alors que plus de la moitié de l’année s’est écoulée, le Plan de réponse humanitaire pour l’Afghanistan pour 2023 reste gravement sous-financé, avec seulement 744 millions de dollars reçus au 31 juillet, soit moins de la moitié du montant (1,49 milliard de dollars) reçu à la même époque en 2022. Les interdictions imposées aux travailleuses humanitaires afghanes ont également engendré des coûts financiers et de fonctionnement supplémentaires qui nécessitent une plus grande souplesse et un financement accru de la part des donateurs. Le Programme alimentaire mondial a prévenu qu’il serait à court de financement d’ici le mois d’octobre 2023 en raison de la réduction du financement des donateurs, ce qui pourrait affecter des millions d’Afghans. 9. Le Rapporteur spécial a entendu à maintes reprises des Afghanes et des Afghans dire que la distribution de l’aide était souvent inégale et pouvait être difficile à obtenir, en particulier pour les groupes minoritaires, les personnes âgées, les ménages dirigés par des femmes et les personnes handicapées, et que les partisans des Taliban seraient favorisés. L’interdiction imposée au personnel féminin réduit la capacité des intervenants humanitaires à fournir effectivement des services aux femmes et aux filles, ce qui se traduit par un ciblage étroit et une compréhension réduite des besoins des populations touchées.",

          "fullText": "Attachments This Gender Alert has been developed by the regional Gender in Humanitarian Action (GiHA) Working Group in Western Region together with the National GIHA WG and the Women Advisory Group (WAG) to the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in Afghanistan. The Gender Alert is based on updates, information and reports received from women organizations and humanitarian actors engaging with women in the Herat province, Western Region of Afghanistan. On 7 October 2023, a magnitude-6.3 earthquake rocked Herat province, in Western Afghanistan, followed by three aftershocks of magnitude 6.3, 5.9 and 5.5, and other smaller shocks. Most casualties and damages were located in four villages in the Zenda Jan district. As of 8 October, 2,000 were estimated to have died, over 9,000 were injured and 1,300 houses, representing almost 100% of all houses, were completely destroyed'. This alert aims to provide insights on the immediate and medium term needs of women and girls affected by the earthquake. Findings: situation of women and immediate needs Protection concerns for women and girls are on the rise: 63% of KIl participants in an IRC assessment who reported that their community members have access to latrine said that those latrines were not safe for women and girls to use”. 100% and 96% of KII respondents mentioned that girls and women respectively were more at risk. Women first responders and health workers in Herat regional hospital highlighted that soap, underwear, menstrual hygiene products are lacking, while food items were deemed available in sufficient quantities. Preliminary reports evidenced that affected communities required immediate psychosocial support, to complement other health interventions. Women health workers reported that the recurring aftershocks trigger strong reactions from patients, evidencing high-level of trauma. The earthquake is likely to worsen the mental health crisis that Afghan women are experiencing. 89% of women from the Western Region had already shared that their mental health had gotten worse in the period April to July 2023. Initial reports from women also highlighted that many casualties were caused by the most powerful aftershocks, and populations’ lack of earthquake safety and preparedness. Women may be more at risk of not obtaining information on earthquake preparedness, due to restrictions imposed on their rights and mobilities, as well as restrictions imposed on women humanitarian workers. Following the destruction of entire villages by the earthquake, initial reports mention that women-headed households, unaccompanied minors and unaccompanied elderly, were being relocated to a camp located in Herat City. Women headed households in particular may experience this relocation differently as they may not have a man who can access services on their behalf, and may no longer be able to rely on informal networks to receive information and assistance.",

          "fullText": "The widespread deployment of mines and cluster munitions in Ukraine has made it the most heavily mined country in the world today. Norway will more than double its support to efforts to clear mines laid in Ukraine since the start of Russia’s brutal war of aggression. ‘Clearing mines saves lives and protects civilians, especially children. Mine clearance is also essential to be able to provide other types of emergency assistance and rebuild infrastructure. Preventing further loss of life also helps to strengthen Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russia’s aggression,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt. The Norwegian Government has therefore decided to provide an additional NOK 200 million in funding earmarked for clearance of mines and other explosives in Ukraine. Clearance of mines and other explosives is a key priority area both for the Ukrainians themselves and for Norwegian efforts in Ukraine. Ukraine’s own post-war recovery plan identifies humanitarian mine clearance as one of the top five priorities. The Ukrainian authorities will place particular focus on restoration of agricultural land and reconstruction of critical infrastructure. Approximately 30 % of Ukraine’s land area is now littered with mines and unexploded ordnance. Demining is vital to enable Ukrainian farmers to cultivate their crops. Prior to Russia’s invasion, Ukraine was known as the breadbasket of the world. Now, hundreds of millions of people in vulnerable areas outside Ukraine are at risk of starvation due to the decline in Ukrainian grain production and attacks by Russia on Ukrainian ports and grain exports. ‘Russia’s military aggression on Ukrainian territory is affecting more than just Ukraine. It is threatening food security across the entire world,’ said Ms Huitfeldt. Norway has provided NOK 164 million for mine clearance activities since Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022. The Norwegian Government has now decided to increase its funding for humanitarian mine clearance activities significantly. The funds will be channelled through established mine clearance organisations including Norwegian People’s Aid, the HALO Trust and the UN system. The funds are being allocated under the Nansen Support Programme for Ukraine. Norway has provided support for mine clearance activities in Ukraine since 2015 and has extensive experience with mine clearance in the area. Norway has now provided more than NOK 4.5 billion in humanitarian support to Ukraine and the refugee response in neighbouring countries. State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Eivind Vad Petersson will be taking part in the International Donor Conference on Humanitarian Demining in Ukraine to be held in Zagreb on 11 October. The conference will bring together the major donors to mine clearance efforts in Ukraine. The new NOK 200 million allocation from Norway will be announced at the conference.",

          "fullText": "The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the United Nations-Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) held simulation exercises for the Building on Social Protection for Anticipatory Action and Response in Emergencies and Disasters (B-SPARED) Project in two pilot areas in Mindanao. The B-SPARED Project is an Anticipatory Action (AA) pilot initiative that aims to implement various protective measures before the onset of disasters to mitigate risks and shocks, as well as to help break the cycle of poverty among vulnerable groups due to recurring natural hazards. The first simulation exercise was conducted in selected barangays in Bacuag, Surigao del Norte on September 28 and 29, according to Maria Arlyn Gerez, chief of the Disaster Preparedness and Response Division (DPRD) which is under the Disaster Response Management Bureau of the DSWD. “The simulation exercise highlighted typhoon interventions which included emergency cash pay-outs and early evacuation of boats,” Gerez said. On October 7, flood interventions including cash pay-outs and distribution of tight-lid drums for storage of agricultural products were also simulated in Cotabato and select barangays in the municipality of Midsayap. Gerez said the series of simulation exercises is a good opportunity for key actors to test the effectiveness of B-SPARED, particularly government systems and processes that support its implementation. “These include the utilization of the National Household Targeting System (NHTS) for the selection of beneficiaries as part of strengthening our social protection systems in place,” Gerez pointed out. Gerez explained that the exercise also serves to “strengthen the collaboration between and among our various partners involving the UN-FAO, provincial and municipal local government partners, the private sector and local communities to protect and build the resiliency of the poor and vulnerable in times of emergencies and disasters.” FAO Social Policy and Programme Coordinator Ruth Honculada-Georget said the exercises provided important lessons and challenges that inform the evolving work in AA with government’s social protection programs and systems. “The key insights we have gained are critical as we work with the DSWD and our partners in harnessing programs such as the 4Ps conditional cash transfer program and the national poverty registry (Listahanan 3). We are proud to partner with the DSWD and local government units which are leading the way in addressing food insecurity and preventing the disruption of livelihoods before a disaster strikes, especially among the poorest households,” Honculada-Georget said. The collaboration is based on the Cooperation Agreement between the DSWD and the UN-FAO in 2021 to operationalize an integrated approach using disaster risk reduction protocols, and social protection systems to scale up a humanitarian response. The simulation exercises were conducted with the support of the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (EU-CPHAO). Anticipatory Action or AA is an innovative humanitarian approach that systematically links early warnings to a set of interventions aimed at protecting at-risk families and their assets ahead of a hazard, using science-based forecasts and risk analysis. #",

Assistance is ongoing in the affected areas, with some delays in assessments and data collection caused by a communication outage in Benghazi. After the school year started with a delay in the east last week, Derna schools reopened for recreational activities and psychosocial support on 8 October. About 98 schools remain closed due to damage or other flood-related access issues in the affected areas, five of them in Derna. Eleven schools continue to host displaced people. Food prices stabilized on an increased level with some exceptions. Banking services have been restored, with limitations on withdrawal amounts and access to digital banking. The UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team that arrived in Libya on 13 September ended its mission on 7 October, after supporting the establishment of coordination structures and completing a multi-thematic needs assessment. 250K People in need. 146K People reached. 42K internally displaced. 4.3K Deaths. 8.5K Missing. 1.2K Cases of watery diarrhea. SITUATION OVERVIEW. IOM and partners assessed 38 collective centres for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and found that 14 are currently occupied by about 1,800 people. This is a significant decrease from the initial count of about 3,300 people hosted in 37 sites. An ongoing communication outage and security concerns in and around Benghazi delayed further data collection in Benghazi. A total of 34 schools in affected areas were repurposed to host IDPs in the first days after the floods. As of 10 October, 11 remain collective IDP centres; 23 have been vacated and reopened for education. In Benghazi, collective centres hosting families from Derna were reportedly closed. There are unconfirmed reports that families have been offered a rental subsidy. IDPs originally from Tawergha and secondarily displaced after the floods still live in school buildings and have not been offered rental assistance. IDPs in Albayda schools were moved to two hotels. In Derna, most IDPs in schools have reportedly been registered and promised cash-for-rent assistance. One school in Derna still hosts IDPs. The local Derna Relief Committee has to date registered 4,000 displaced households and estimates there are in total 5,000 displaced households (about 25,000 individuals) in Derna, compared to 16,000 IDPs in Derna recorded by IOM-DTM. Derna schools reopened on 8 October with a two-week mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and recreational programme. Resumption of formal education is planned for 28 October. Five damaged schools in Derna remain closed. UNHCR and partners are advocating for equal access to assistance for all affected people, including IDPs who were secondarily displaced, non-Libyans and other vulnerable groups. Displacement, death of family members, the destruction of houses, the loss of livelihood and trauma have resulted in new vulnerabilities, particularly for unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) and newly widowed women and their families. Reliable data on these affected groups is not available yet due to lack of registration and death certificates, as well as the high number (8,500) of people still missing. UNICEF and child protection partners are working with local authorities on rapid registration of children who have been separated from both parents. Key messages have been distributed to partners, authorities and communities and a child protection case management system is being put in place for family tracing, reunification and alternative care options. UASC are particularly vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, abuse, denial of access to basic services, trauma and the lack of identification papers. UNFPA estimates that up to 24,000 of the women and girls who need humanitarian assistance are pregnant and lacking essential sexual and reproductive health services. About one in ten of that number are expected to give birth in the next month. WHO is leading efforts to establish standards and a coordination mechanism to address affected people’s high demand for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS). According to WFP, banking services are accessible again for people in the affected areas, but the maximum cash withdrawal is limited to an average amount of 3,000 LYD (approximately US$610) per month. UN advocacy efforts are ongoing to request the registration of customers for digital methods of payments to ease transfers to and within Libya, increase the withdrawal ceiling for humanitarian agencies and ensure cash supply to flood-affected areas. WFP and IOM assessed market functionality in affected areas. Prices have mostly stabilized on an increased level, except for eggs. About 50 per cent of households continue to report issues with accessibility, affordability and availability of essential goods. Disruption in local markets and economic activities was reported by 8 per cent of households. Further market functionality analysis is underway, including a cash partner and REACH Initiative Joint Rapid Market Assessment (JRMA) to gain insights into the availability of non-food and minimum expenditure food items. Further related assessments are planned by FAO and UNDP, with focus on early recovery and the agricultural sector. The UNDAC team left Libya on 7 October. During its three-week deployment, UNDAC, including OCHA staff and operational partners from REACH, iMMAP, MapAction, Atlas Logistics, Télécoms Sans Frontières, and the EU supported humanitarian coordination, needs assessments and information management. UNDP conducted an analysis of satellite imagery and data for seven severely affected areas, including Derna, Benghazi, Almarj, Albayda, Shahhat, Sousa and Altamimi to evaluate damage to critical infrastructure and debris generation. UNDP's collaboration with the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) was valuable due to limited access in these areas. UNDP experts joined to support the debris removal, disposal and development of related guidelines. Disclaimer",

          "fullText": "Trócaire's call for immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and lasting peace in Israel and Palestine. Trócaire is horrified by the recent escalation of violence across Israel and Palestine and condemns the indiscriminate attacks, hostage taking and killing of innocent civilians that have taken place during the Hamas incursion into Israel in recent days, acts that amount to war crimes. We are deeply concerned by Israel’s decision to block the entrance of food, fuel and electricity to the Gaza Strip. Imposing a total closure of the Strip amounts to collective punishment of an unprecedented scale, on an already vulnerable and impoverished population. Women and children will bear the brunt of these extreme actions. Furthermore, the indiscriminate bombing and the intentional attacks against the Palestinian civilian population and infrastructure such as hospitals and schools by the Israeli army also amount to war crimes. Trócaire calls on all parties involved in the conflict to immediately cease hostilities and all relevant stakeholders to ensure that critical humanitarian access and supports such as food, water and medical supplies are guaranteed. It is imperative that international law is respected by all parties and that civilians and humanitarian workers are protected from harm. Additionally, there needs to be full accountability for all violations of international law. The latest violence has resulted not only in the loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives but is exacerbating an already unbearable situation in the Gaza Strip where 80% of the population are dependent on humanitarian assistance and poverty levels are catastrophically high. Trócaire wants peace in Israel and Palestine. We want that peace to be based on mutual respect and understanding, with security, justice and equality for all. Decades of military occupation and 16 years of a blockade of the Gaza Strip, along with the systematic discrimination and oppression that Palestinians endure daily, have continued to erode the possibilities for this to be achieved and have deepened and entrenched poverty levels. There is an compelling need to address these root causes urgently and comprehensively, and it is incumbent on the international community to take immediate steps to this end. Trócaire will continue to monitor the situation closely and will stay in close contact with our local partners over the coming hours and days to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need.",

          "fullText": "The number of Afghan refugees moving along the Balkan Route has remained very high this summer. A large proportion of those taking the long trip to central, western and northern Europe are in their early twenties and many are under-age. From Turkey, they usually cross Greece and Bulgaria in order to reach Serbia. Once there, most opt for the ‘Western Balkan route’ leading through Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia and finally Italy where routes for further possible destinations split once again. Among these countries, Croatia became, in January 2023, the European Union’s foremost external border facing the Balkan Route, while non-EU Serbia, remains a midway staging point for migrants, beyond the EU borders yet conveniently close to their final destinations. During a recent visit to Croatia and Serbia, and through long-term observation from the vantage point of Trieste, the Italian city close to Croatia and Slovenia to which one of the western branches of the Balkan Route leads, AAN’s Fabrizio Foschini has sought to understand what is happening to Afghans transiting through these two, very diverse, yet closely connected, countries. Almost ten years ago, a young Afghan told me the story of how he had been unwittingly tricked by Croatia’s membership of the EU. After an odyssey of several months across Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary he was one of those low-budget DIY travellers who, without even a GPS, counted only on their skills to make it to their destination he had managed to cross the Serbian-Croatian border undetected. Coming out of a plum tree orchard where he had spent the night, and still wet from having waded a creek to get there the previous evening, he walked into a Croatian hamlet and inquired from the first person he met his basic whereabouts: “Which country am I in? Is it in the European Union?” “Yes!” was the somewhat upbeat reply. “This is Croatia, we’re in the EU!” It took my friend, who had hurried to the nearest police station and duly applied for asylum, hoping his roaming was over, some days to understand that the people he had met were highly enthusiastic because Croatia had in fact just joined the EU a few days previously, in that fateful July of 2013. It took him some more time to realise that the country had no proper reception system yet and offered no viable chances to asylum seekers, at least not to Afghans.[1] He eventually decided and managed to leave Croatia and told me his tale when he was freshly arrived in Trieste, where he would apply for and eventually obtain asylum. Croatia’s position in refugees’ mental geography of the so-called Balkan Route has become clearer since those early days, and more sharply defined: had my friend hit the border four or five years later, he would not have thought of grabbing the chance to seek asylum there. Croatia is now largely seen by migrants as an obstacle to overcome during their hoped-for movement westwards and its security forces and government’s attitude as uncompromisingly hostile. Maybe it is not so paradoxical that Afghan migrants’ increasingly poor perception of Croatia has developed in the same years that saw the completion of Croatia’s accession to full EU membership. In January 2023, it made the last two big steps forward, with the adoption of the EU’s common currency, the euro, and entry into the Schengen Agreement, a treaty which led to the creation of the Schengen Area in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. Bulgaria and Romania are members of the EU, but not Schengen, while Greece, a Schengen member, has a sea border with the rest of the Union, something which facilitates its control of migrants’ movement. That leaves Croatia, together with Hungary to the north, the main external border for those approaching the EU from the southeast. EU strategies and concerns about what it deems ‘the migrant crisis’, therefore inform Croatia’s policies and behaviour towards migrants more than the internal political debate about them. This is also because, so far, despite the migrants having a highly visible presence, very few have stopped and settled in Croatia. However, an increase in the number of asylum requests filed in Croatia during the first months of 2023 pointed to possible imminent changes in the country’s position and role in migration along the Balkan Route, and inspired this research and report. Let us then first have a look at some numbers. Asylum seekers in Croatia: inflow and outflow. In the first six months of 2023, the most important entry to the EU for Afghans remained what is known as the Western Balkan route.[2] It was along this route that the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, listed the highest numbers of detections of illegal border crossings by Afghan nationals 6,392 far more than the 2,437 detections along the Eastern Mediterranean route (from Turkey into Greece or Bulgaria or from Turkey by sea to the Greek islands or to Italy).[3] The Frontex numbers look to be an undercount given the increasing trend in migration in recent years. Moreover, in 2022, in Croatia alone, the Ministry of Interior reported far more: 14,877 illegal border crossings and 1,390 asylum requests provided by the Ministry of Interior. Actual figures for Afghans travelling along the Western Balkan route must be even higher, given there are also undetected border crossings by Afghans. For example, in 2022, Hungary effected more than 25,300 pushbacks of Afghan nationals to Serbia, according to its police statistics (quoted by the Asylum Information Database AIDA). A majority of Afghans, moreover, unlike Syrians who typically try to cross north into Hungary (the most direct route to their destinations in northern Europe), opt to keep moving west, from Serbia through Bosnia and then Croatia, on the western branch of the Balkan Route which leads towards Italy. This will be the specific focus of this report.[4] The constant flow of Afghans arriving at Italy’s north-eastern border further provides a glimpse of the overall numbers moving through Croatia. In 2022, the number of migrants crossing from Slovenia into Italy, traced by the Border Police of Trieste, or who spontaneously presented themselves to the authorities there, amounted to around 13,000. This figure coincides roughly with the number of migrants in transit assessed by a group of solidarity organisations active in the city, which also estimated that over half were Afghans, (see their recent report ). In particular, according to them, in the third quarter of 2022, Afghans made up 75 per cent of the total number of migrants transiting through Trieste. In the case of non-accompanied minors arriving in Trieste, Afghans accounted for 85 per cent of the total during 2022. In Croatia itself, these two trends, the increase in the numbers of overall arrivals and of Afghans, were also monitored. In 2022, 12,872 asylum requests (of all nationalities) were made, against a mere 3,039 of 2021 (see AIDA’s annual country report about Croatia). Then in 2023, the first partial data showed an enormous jump in asylum requests: by 20 March, as many as 6,280 individuals had applied for asylum in Croatia, an 800 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2022. By 30 June, according to the Ministry of Interior’s statistics Croatia had received 24,367 asylum requests, among them, the majority (5,925) filed by Afghan nationals. It was difficult not to link the new pace of asylum requests with the changed political and economic situation of 2023 Croatia joining the Schengen agreement and adopting the euro. The game-changer of being inside Schengen, for example, was mentioned by an unnamed police official to the Croatian daily,    *Previously they went to Slovenia, a Schengen member and sought asylum there because then they could no longer be returned to a country outside of Schengen. Now that Croatia in is Schengen, they don’t need to wait to arrive in Slovenia, so they’re asking for asylum here. * Was it possible that a Croatia now in Schengen could become more attractive as a destination for migrants, and that those who had just transited through it, could become more interested in trying to stay, given the country’s fast-expanding economy and its hunger for cheap seasonal labour in tourist sector? Moreover, this year, Croatia fell into line with most other EU countries with respect to the waiting time imposed on asylum seekers before they can legally seek a job; it was brought down from nine months to just three. A second look at the situation however quickly dispelled this theory. Firstly, the assumption that all asylum requests would lead to those seeking asylum remaining in Croatia is misleading. A number of factors point to relatively few new asylum seekers stopping in the country for good. They include the fact that the increase in asylum requests in Croatia was paralleled by migrants transiting through to Trieste. Also, the numbers of recorded illegal entries into Croatia and Slovenia (the next country along the route westwards to Italy) during the first six months of 2023 were roughly equivalent 26,871 and 25,431 respectively (see for example figures given in this report by Ansa ). This points to the outflow of migrants from Croatia into Slovenia keeping pace with the number of new arrivals, including those who applied for asylum. In 2021, researchers at the University of Zagreb had assessed that almost 90 per cent of those applying for asylum in Croatia left the country after a short time, leaving their requests pending. The current estimate is that around 85 per cent do so. Further elements reinforce the likelihood that few of the new asylum seekers stop in Croatia for good. As already mentioned, so far, Afghans constitute by far the most numerous group of asylum seekers in Croatia this year. Yet it is realistic to infer that, in the case of Afghans even more than other national groups, the great majority leave the country and move westwards. According to information shared by a Zagreb-based independent organisation offering legal assistance and advocacy for asylum seekers the Centre for Peace Studies ( Centar za mirovne studije , CMS), asylum requests made by Afghans in Croatia are usually rejected, even after appeal (in both the 2nd and 3rd instances). Despite an increased focus on Afghans on the part of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) and its partner organisations in Croatia, such as CMS, this is not yet reflected in changes in the asylum policy at the national level. Only a negligible number of Afghans, mostly individuals who worked with NATO forces and could prove direct collaboration with Croatians, managed to settle in Croatia after being evacuated in 2021. Few Afghans would choose to stop in a country showing such reticence in granting asylum, especially when they are so close to more attractive destinations deeper inside the EU. Croatian police behaviour towards Afghans likely plays another key role in keeping them on the move. The country’s borders with Bosnia and Serbia are heavily patrolled, along with transit routes in the interior; according to the Croatian Prime minister , 6,700 police guard and patrol the border. The Croatian police often engage in so-called ‘pushbacks’ that is, the immediate and illegal expulsion of individuals who may have applied for asylum if given the opportunity. Migrants intercepted by the police not only close to the border, but even at greater distances from it, are routinely brought back and forced to re-enter Bosnia on foot, without a formal transfer to Bosnian authorities, and usually through deserted tracts of the border far away from their original crossing point. CMS have estimated that around 25,000 pushbacks to Bosnia took place in the years 2019-21 (with smaller numbers to Serbia). The overall number of pushbacks may have slightly diminished in 2022 the Danish Refugee Council counted 3,461 pushbacks to Bosnia; however, Afghan nationals constituted the main victims of this practice, with 919 such cases. In the first six months of 2023, the volume of pushbacks involving Afghans has continued unabated, with 475 recorded. Instances of police abuse against migrants have been consistently reported and denounced by NGO workers and the media in Croatia and elsewhere over the past few years and were recently detailed in a major report by Human Rights Watch . Leaving aside the issue of ‘chain-pushbacks’, which involve more than one country, in this case Slovenia and Italy (more on this later), such abuses range from the blanket denial of access to asylum to arbitrary detention, theft and damage of personal property, physical violence and degrading treatment. As documented in a CMS report , police officers who take part in such operations most often have their faces covered to avoid identification and likewise cover up the pushback as instances of prevention of illegal border crossings. Despite a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that held Croatia responsible for the death of a six-year-old Afghan girl, Madina Hosseini, who was run over by a train after being pushed back by the police to Serbia in 2017, the Croatian police continue with their abusive practices. They have evidently become engrained in the operational routine of Croatian police forces tasked by their and other European governments, which support Croatian border control economically and operationally through Frontex, with checking unauthorised migration. The actions of the Croatian police should be considered an integral part of the deterrence measures put in place to ‘protect’ the whole of the European Union, not just their own country: the push-backs are just one of a range of measures bureaucratic hurdles, low recognition rates and threats of deportations variously deployed by different EU countries. Even when Afghans are not subjected to pushbacks, NGO workers reported that they are often treated worse than other migrant groups, such as the (far fewer) Syrians, so that the idea that they are not welcome in Croatia is quickly and firmly impressed upon the transiting migrants. A number of conversations with Afghan refugees travelling through Croatia corroborated this point. Talking to Afghans outside of Porin Hotel. The main reception centre in Croatia is in the former Hotel Porin, on the southern outskirts of Zagreb. The centre opened in 2011 with a capacity of 600. Although meant for single men, it currently hosts a mixed population which includes several families.[5] The authorities might have considered its location, away from the city centre, to be convenient. It has proved uncomfortable for those living there. There is a foul-smelling major waste disposal nearby, a huge and largely abandoned freight train exchange station and untended expanses of grass. The area swarmed with ravenous mosquitoes even more than the average Zagreb suburbs in the wet and stormy summer of 2023. The camp is closed to all but government personnel and the Red Cross. Médecins Sans Frontières used to have access but has recently suspended its operations there. However, Afghan migrants are regularly to be found moving around the old hotel’s fenced precincts, squatting in the greenery that surrounds it, exchanging information or walking back from the city after a failed departure. At lunchtime, in particular, many Afghans who have not been able to secure accommodation in the complex try to obtain some food from their acquaintances inside. For someone who used to speak to migrants on the Balkan Route a few years back, as well as to those arriving in Trieste, the first contact with Afghans in 2023 Croatia was telling. The first person, a particularly sombre-looking young man from Maidan Wardak, apologised profusely in Dari for requesting to see my ID. He would not talk to me unless he could reassure himself beyond any doubt that I was not linked to either the Croatian security forces or Frontex. I’ve just been let out of police detention, you know. I spent last night in the hold-up. I’d arrived here yesterday morning, the police identified me and sent me to the camp [Porin] . I left the camp shortly after and went to the train station to catch a train and continue my journey. However, before the train started, the police checked it, carriage by carriage, and there was no place to hide. They were very angry at me for leaving the camp, and even more so for having taken the train. They said, “You have no right to board trains or buses here, you can only move around the way you came walking.” They brought me to the police station and kept me there for the night. As soon as I’d fall asleep, somebody would make a noise or shake me to force me to stay awake. Then they let me go, but told me: “Go on or we’ll deport you back to where you came from.” The Croatian police don’t care about us applying for asylum. They only want to fingerprint us because the more fingerprints they take, the more money they receive from the EU. According to CMS in Zagreb, Afghans crossing into Croatia face three possible legal outcomes, if caught by the police and identified as migrants. Some migrants receive access to asylum applications and are subsequently sent to Porin or another reception centre from where most eventually resume their trip westwards. A second possibility is that the person receives a ‘return decision’, a seven-day warrant ordering them to leave Croatia. 30,000 such decisions were issued in 2022, in particular to migrants from Burundi (who used to be able to travel to Serbia without visas) but also to many Afghans. Reportedly, this practice is continuing without a clear pattern and leaves migrants facing an uncertain fate. The return decision in fact can result in their being allowed to continue traveling, or their being held and then pushed back to Bosnia. A third option an expulsion decision has also become more frequent this year (more details in this analysis by Balkaninsight), especially after a ministerial summit of the western Balkan countries and the EU in Rome in April 2023. Migrants may be issued an expulsion decision, which results in Bosnia formally readmitting them. They are delivered to the Bosnian police. This is reported to have happened even after a person asked for asylum in Croatia.[6] Whichever they get authorised to ask for asylum, given a seven-day warrant to leave the country or a formal expulsion decision it is difficult for migrants to make sense of any of it. At least when it comes to Afghan nationals, there were many complaints about the paucity of translation services and communication in general on the part of the police. The complaint of a young man from Takhar province, formerly a member of the Afghan National Army (ANA), was echoed by nearly all his compatriots: “There’s never an interpreter with them [the police], the paperwork is all in Croatian and many policemen don’t even bother to try to speak English with you.” Most Afghans AAN spoke to were convinced they had not applied for asylum in Croatia, although they had given their fingerprints to the European Asylum Dactyloscopy Database (Eurodac). According to the Dublin Regulation, once a person is identified by the Croatian police, their asylum request is up to Croatia to process, because it was their EU country of entry, even if they do not afterwards complete their application there.[7] They are also be liable to be sent back to Croatia, if they travelled on to another EU member state. The readmission of Dublin cases to Croatia is a relatively frequent instance, and actually one on the rise since Croatia’s accession to Schengen, especially by countries with big volumes of Afghan asylum seekers, such as Switzerland. The phenomenon led a group of Croatian NGOs to travel to Bern in mid-June to meet the Swiss Secretary of State for Migration to advocate for a stop to the practice. They cited the lack of sufficient capacity in their country’s reception system for accommodating refugees (read about the delegation in the Swiss press ). Being sent back, of course, does not necessarily prevent migrants from trying to travel west again and apply for asylum elsewhere. The Porin hotel was fully booked during the days AAN was in Zagreb. Afghans hanging around the hotel said that some newcomers had been made to sleep in the hallways and others could simply not be accommodated inside and slept rough in abandoned wagons in the nearby railway area. When the author visited in late July, the rough sleeping was especially grim, as Zagreb was hit by a quite unprecedented hurricane. It caused extensive damage and several deaths in the city. The Croatian capital was ravaged by bouts of heavy rains and wind for the full following week. One of the Afghans sleeping rough outside Porin was a young boy from Dand-e Ghuri in Baghlan province. Hardly looking as old as the 16 years he claimed, he had been sent by the Croatian police to what he termed “a camp for minors” (likely the reception centre in Kutina) upon arrival. He left it after just one day, however, and proceeded to Zagreb, but could not find a place inside Porin. While waiting for some sympathetic compatriot to bring him food from inside the hotel, he related what had led him to leave in haste the arguably better reception he would have received at the camp for minors: I left my country two years ago, shortly before the fall of the Republic. I wasted a lot of time in Turkey because I had no money to pay for the next leg of the trip. I worked as a shepherd near Istanbul, and also in the city, but it was never enough. My family sold everything in order to have me out of Afghanistan. They sold the last sack of rice, even some of the little land they owned. My little sister is at home. My whole family is only waiting for me to get to some place where I can start to help them. It’s two years I’ve been gone and not a single time have I been able to send some shirini [literally ‘sweets’, presents or sums of money given as gifts to relatives, friends or associates] to my father. There’s no money left at home. How could there be? We are sharecroppers: one quarter of our harvest the Taleban take as taxes, one quarter goes to the landlord, one quarter is just for our own consumption to eat and stay alive, and with the sale of the remaining quarter you have to meet all the other expenses of the family. The time I spent in Turkey, the way I used to slave for a small sum of money there made me reflect a lot. Now I need to get somewhere fast, somewhere I can get an education, find a good job, start a different life. As for where this more favourable final destination could be, in the minds of those traveling, there are a few recurrent ideas. While some mention France and potentially further, possibly to the UK, or Switzerland, most seem to be directed to Germany. However, the majority of those interviewed by AAN declared they aimed first to get to Italy, and so were trying to catch a train or bus to Rijeka, Croatia’s Adriatic seaport, only 50 kilometres away as the crow flies from its ‘twin’ city in Italy, Trieste. Migrants cannot fly, however, or even, apparently, be allowed to take a bus or train, but must only walk. Two former members of the ANA from Mazar-e Sharif related what had happened to them the day before: *Yesterday, we went to the main station to catch a train, but the police were on the platform and sent us back to the camp [Porin]. They called a taxi and forced us to take it and followed us in their car. The taxi driver had first said the ride would cost 30 euros and we gave it to him, but then he started saying that it was 30 for each of us and got angry at our refusal to pay the additional money, so he stopped the cab after just a couple of blocks and the police came and threw our backpacks out of the car and we had to walk back to the camp. The policemen told us we could continue our trip, but not by any form of transport. They even threatened us: Go quick, move on or we’ll deport you back to Afghanistan. * Taxi drivers are a key component in what Afghans call ‘the Game’, played along this section of the route, both as transporters of migrants for short distances, but also, often, as police informers. From Serbia onwards, the role of traffickers is much less direct and their presence on the ground negligible. Of course, there are those traveling under more high-profile and costly arrangements, such as direct transport by vehicle, which according to one police investigation can cost up to 5,000 euros from Bosnia to Italy or up to 8,000 euros if somebody wants to get further west, for example to Spain. However, most migrants, especially single young men, are left to themselves after they leave Serbia and cross the border into Bosnia. The traffickers keep in touch over the phone and provide guidance by sending GPS positions which they must reach, stage by stage. A short distance from the gates of Porin, the author met a group of Afghans squatting in the tall grass, listening attentively to a twenty-year old from Bagram talking in Pashto with smugglers on his phone. He was telling them about the difficulty of boarding public transport and the poor conditions of his and his companions’ feet after the tiresome trekking they had been forced to do in the previous days and afterwards recounted to the author his recent journey. I arrived two days ago. I slept outside Porin, I cannot enter [the complex] or eat there as I gave no fingerprints to the police I actually have not met any so far. I came all the way with a friend from my district. We paid 3,000 USD to travel from Turkey to Serbia. During that part of the trip, we always had a rahbalad [guide]* with us and when we were detained for some days in Bulgaria, somebody from our smuggler network waited until we were out and guided us into Serbia. From Serbia onwards, we were alone. Now it works through ‘locations’ only. The smugglers give you a series of locations via GPS and you follow them: a station, a road, a border crossing.* *From Belgrade, they brought us to a river border and told us to jump into the water to get into Bosnia. On the other side we took a taxi. It cost 50 euros for each of the passengers to be brought close to Bihac. Then we went to a camp called Lipa and after around a week, we crossed into Croatia. On the way, there were people coming back to the camp whose phones had been broken or stolen by the Croatian police. We crossed a forest which had no paths. Luckily we met no police, although we could hear the drones buzzing over our heads. Then we walked until Zagreb. Now we’re waiting for the new location from our contact. Altogether, for the trip, Bosnia to Italy *[with locations], you pay 700 USD if the trafficker is a rafiq [a friend or associate] , otherwise 800 USD. The chances are that somebody among the migrants gets a discount if he becomes a jelawro (‘lead-the-way’), informally taking charge of a small group and keeping in touch with the smuggler network to enhance the group’s possibilities of successfully arriving at the next stage (and the smugglers’ of getting paid in full). Recently, there have been press reports about an increase in the number of traffickers arrested by the Croatian police. According to CMS, many of these arrests have been made among migrants who had reached Rijeka or other places far from the border with Bosnia. This could point towards their real role, as jelawros , rather than real members of a smuggling network. Besides providing a barrier on behalf of the EU at the border with non-EU Bosnia (it became a candidate country only in December 2022), Croatian police efforts seem directed at keeping pressure on migrants to move on once they are inside Croatia. Over the past few years, for example, the route from Zagreb to Rijeka (by train or bus), from Rijeka (by train) to the inland town of Buzet on the Istrian peninsula (the westernmost area of Croatia which bulges out into the Adriatic Sea) and from there on foot across Slovenian territory (at its narrowest point around 15 km) and into Italy, had become well-established. Police crackdowns on migrants in Rijeka have recently caused part of the flow to shift towards Pula, a seaport at the tip of the Istrian peninsula, a detour for those trying to get to Italy. The aim of this ‘keeping migrants on the move’ is probably to make sure one single route does not become too prominent and crowded, with the risk of it developing into a public scandal or something which could tarnish the image of the country advertised as a tourist paradise. Crossing Croatia is not as gruelling as crossing Bulgaria, with its higher levels of abuse and violence, or an impassable obstacle such as Hungary. Still, it comes like a cold shower for migrants convinced that they have finally overcome the harshest part of their trip, that they are finally on the doorstep of western Europe and that with that, will come better standards of reception and human rights, as one man said: In Serbia and Bosnia, the people are good and the police don’t bother us migrants. *In Croatia, we’re treated like animals. Elsewhere, the violence, the hostile behaviour is on the border and once you’ve made it away from there, you’re fine, people aren’t hostile and the police don’t bother you. So, once you’ve arrived here in Zagreb from the forests on the Bosnian border, you think you’ve come out of the jangal [the jungle, here used also in a figurative sense] and reached ‘the city’. But then, you realise that the behaviour of the police here in the capital is the same as on the border. Actually, the police here mistreat you as you would expect someone to do in the jungle, while out there in ‘the jungle’ [referring here to the refugee camps of the Bosnian Una-Sana canton, located in forested areas] people were treating us in a more civilised way. * The Zagreb government’s hostile attitude is compounded by the migrants’ own lack of interest in remaining in Croatia; hence, they seldom reach out to the very committed organisations which offer legal aid and other forms of support. The positive perception of police and Bosnian and Serbian people’s attitudes noted by the two ex-soldiers from Mazar and many other migrants AAN spoke to reflected their personal experience, that is, of a relatively swift and smooth crossing. However, the full picture is not so rosy nor so simple in Serbia and Bosnia, which have been at the centre of the ‘migrant crisis’ for years, as the author discovered when he took a closer look at the situation of Afghan migrants still in Serbia. Talking and walking in Belgrade. For many migrants, having experienced a first taste of the EU in Greece or Bulgaria, Serbia may look like a comparatively relaxed stage of the trip. Access to asylum-seeking is available, but not everywhere: according to members of a Serbian NGO providing legal and psychosocial support to migrants, Klikaktiv , the police do not easily provide the possibility to register outside Belgrade and even in the capital, this opportunity is not available at all times. Despite improvements in the reception capacity of the 17 camps active across Serbia, for which the EU is the major funder, not many possibilities are offered to those who apply for asylum besides accommodation. The wait to legally seek employment amounts to nine months and, before a positive decision has been made, according to migrants solidarity organisations in Belgrade, no language or professional courses are available. At any given moment, there are around 3,000 migrants hosted in the reception centres, but very few opt to remain in Serbia. Most move quickly on to Bosnia and Croatia. Serbia’s role is mainly one of transit, and in recent years, of an increasingly swift transit. According to the annual report by the Serbian Commissariat for Refugees and Migration, 124,127 migrants were registered and hosted in reception centres during 2022. On average, they stayed in the country for 16 days, a considerable decrease from the 30 days of 2021 or the 36 of 2020. Reportedly, over 73,000 migrants had already transited through Serbia’s camps in the first six months of 2023. Afghans were the most represented nationality to pass through the Serbian reception centres in 2022, amounting to over 36 per cent of the total. It is often vulnerable cases, families or people with medical conditions who access reception centres out of their own free will. They may need to stop for a short while in order to recover, while other migrants try to continue on their path almost immediately. Outside the official camps, there is indeed another migrant population in Serbia, estimated at between 3-4,000 and constantly flowing into and out of the country and thereby renewing itself. This is centred on smugglers’ rented safehouses and the many squats located on the northern border with Hungary. At the western border with Bosnia, there is also a constant flow, but far less ‘housing’ because it is easier and quicker to cross. The crossing into Bosnia is also the route generally favoured by Afghans, many of whom therefore end up stopping in Serbia for only a couple of days. According to both migrants and NGO workers interviewed by AAN, crossing into Bosnia is now relatively easy. From Belgrade, migrants move to minor border crossings near quiet towns in western Serbia such as Loznica. Migrants described wading or swimming across rivers though crossing the Drina, which largely marks the border between the two countries, would require along most of its course advanced swimming skills read here about migrants stranded mid-river. Different interviewees also related crossing rivers by bridges, either secretly, through a system of ropes hung under the bridge, or quite openly just walking across. At some minor border crossings, such as Ljubovija, migrants can be taken across the river into Bosnia directly by car: according to the Serbian NGO, Klikaktiv, it is relatively common to see cavalcades of vehicles with non-local plates crossing this and other nearby ‘sleepy’ border towns. Some migrants may be picked up by cars on the Bosnian side. These ‘all-inclusive’ migrants who pay more and travel fast, stay with smugglers throughout, and are often brought directly to the Croatian frontier and even beyond.[8] The average migrant, however resorts to public transport once on the Bosnian side. On both sides of the frontier, the police often opt to close their eyes to migrants’ crossing, or can be bribed by smugglers if necessary. The lax attitude of the police in Serbia has often been commented positively on by migrants and looks to be a constant from AAN’s previous visit to the country’s migrant squats in 2016 (read this and the other reports from the series). However, things might be changing in this respect, as episodes of violent repression of migrants at border crossings have recently been documented and seem to be on the rise. Klikaktiv has also reported police pressure on migrants trying to use public transport to reach Belgrade from the south. The shift in Serbian police attitudes is not happening only at the borders: a short walk in downtown Belgrade in the same places researched in 2016 at the height of the ‘first Balkan Route crisis’, showed that a lot had changed in the city as well. The area of the once dilapidated central train station in the Savamala neighbourhood, that has since been relocated, has been transformed into a new upscale Belgrade Waterfront project, radically changing the city skyline and profile of the neighbourhood. This means also that the migrants’ presence in the area, previously a ‘natural’ hub for those transiting, is nowadays less tolerated. Around the remains of the old train station in Savamala (read here a report on BBC Serbian about its past glory, and last days), the absence of refugees is made more conspicuous by the signs of their previous presence: PCO shops, where people could phone home or contact smugglers, and kebabs once lining the main avenue are now shut, together with the cheap hostels that would accommodate families or migrants coming to Serbia in a more high-profile way.[9] Tents and shacks have disappeared and illegal squats inside the abandoned wagons near the old train station have been removed. Serbian police are known to raid such urban squats in order to destroy them and deport their occupants to the camps inid near the Croatian border or in Preevo near the border with North Macedonia (read    by Klikaktiv). The nearby park, universally known by migrants as ‘Afghan Park’ since at least 2015, where smugglers used to hold court (read this instalment of the previous AAN series on Afghan migrants in Serbia) now looks to be only frequented by migrants part-time. With the coming of spring and then summer, it started to fill again with newcomer migrants arriving from the Bulgarian or Macedonian border, but they do not spend all their time there and are frequently rounded up and forcibly relocated by the police to camps far away from the city. Arriving at Afghan Park one morning shortly after 11am, the author could witness from afar such an operation. Two dozen migrants, seemingly Afghans, had been made to sit on the grass while a dozen police agents counted and identified them in order to have them board a big police bus, already waiting by the side of the road. Some civilians stayed there throughout the process, possibly NGO workers who had come with their own translator to make sure the migrants were advised and accounted for and that none ended being pushed out of Serbia. Moving a couple of lanes above the park, in front of a line of shops selling hiking gear, a few migrants were apparently waiting for the police operation to be over before moving out of cover. Three were Afghans from the southeast, speaking Pashto over the phone and a bit uneasy about speaking Dari to a stranger. They hurried to declare that they were already accommodated in a camp at the outskirts of the city and had only come to town to do some shopping. Walking down another lane leading back to the park, there was another group of Afghans who had apparently left it in the wake of the police arrival. They were mostly Pashto speakers as well, with at least two very young boys among them. Although arguably keen to put more distance between them and the police bus on the other side of the road, they did not look over-concerned by it (the vehicle was also shielding them from the agents inside the park). However, the conversation with them was cut abruptly short by an old lady from a balcony above, who started protesting loudly that it was not permitted to talk to migrants (arguably taking the author for a local). She kept urging the migrants to go back and immediately report to the police in the park, as it was not allowed for them to stay in the city. Indeed, the Afghans did not look at ease stopping anywhere in the area and kept hurrying onwards, so the interview had to be continued while walking several hundred metres. It was a full reversal of how easy it was to spot and engage in conversation with migrants in Belgrade only a few years back. The information they provided was necessarily sketchy, but its interpretation made somewhat easier by the circumstances. They had not been stopped by the Serbian police and had kept clear of the camps. Although they claimed they were sleeping in various city parks, they seemed to be following a clear leader a tall, bearded guy walking a few dozen metres ahead of them and had shopping bags full of food with them. They said they would stop to rest for a couple of days before hitting ‘the game’ towards Bosnia. When asked if they were ‘ khod-andaz ’ (migrants who self-organise their trip) or were with smugglers, they seemed to find the idea funny and replied “We’re with smugglers, of course.” They added that the police in the park did not see them and they did not wish to be seen, else the police might bring them back to the camps “two hours away [located in the south of Serbia].” They complained that the Serbian police were making some problems for migrants, that people were forced to go to the camps and that the police sometimes sent some of their number back to Bulgaria. On returning to the park, I found it deserted. The migrants had boarded the police bus, which seemed now ready to start. The whole process had taken around one and a half hours. A few more Afghans, altogether not more than half a dozen, were squatting or sleeping in the more secluded parts of the park esplanade in front of the old train station, now a restored monument, not creating even a visible trouble to passers-by. Ironically, above their heads, a big travel agency placard atop an unfinished building promised that with it: “Every day, you could go to Turkey.” Discussions with NGO workers and researchers at Belgrade University confirmed the impression that, regardless of the still significant numbers of migrants passing through Belgrade, they are much less visible in the city. The causes for this are the authorities’ changed attitude, as well also the nature of the operations run by the smuggling networks in Serbia. Migrants constitute a minor source of concern for the Serbian government, provided they do not become too visible in central areas of the city. To disincentivise their presence, besides raids and forced relocation to camps out of the city, the authorities have discontinued the provision of services to migrants in the area. The main hub offering assistance to migrants in the city centre was Miksalite. It had been transformed over the years from a volunteer organisation to a state-run info point (read this paper on its history and the transformations of migrants reception in Belgrade), forced to relocate in 2016 due to the demolitions planned for the Belgrade Waterfront and was shut down for good on 31 December 2022. The withdrawal of the state left a free hand once again for the smugglers, not only to arrange for the migrants to cross frontiers in a swift way, but to organise every other aspect of their stay in Serbia. Today, migrants who do not seek reception in the government camps are fully dependent on the smugglers for transport, accommodation, food and communications hence the lack of need for PCO shops and food stalls. This of course, has its consequences. Migrants who cannot pay smugglers can face serious abuses and are often exploited for labour or sex. Many such migrants have to work for the smugglers in assisting the accommodation or transport of other migrants and are kept in isolation and are very difficult to access, whether by NGOs keen to help, or the security forces. The situation is of particular concern for vulnerable categories, such as unaccompanied minors Klikaktiv assessed that in the first six months of 2023, there were three times as many of these crossing Serbia compared to the same period last year. Recently, there have also been numerous instances of violence between smugglers, believed to be caused by competition between rival groups. The string of violence started in July last year, with a shooting between two rival groups of Afghan smugglers in a squat near the northern border with Hungary, which ended in one member killed and also caused serious injuries to an Iranian girl who was caught in the crossfire. The episode made some impression on the Serbian media back then, but this year, despite several similar incidents at least five, including one recorded in March on the border with Bosnia which resulted in the death of an Afghan they have not attracted much public interest nor police reaction. The fact that they happened in liminal places, such as migrants’ squats or in remote border towns and did not involve Serbian nationals, has so far kept the profile of such crimes low in the eyes of the state and public. Klikaktiv, however, denouncing the threat posed by smugglers to migrants and NGO workers, indeed all citizens, lamented the lack of political will to deal with the problem on the part of the authorities (see their",

Brief background of the incident: In the early hours of 4thOctober 2023, there was a sudden surge in flow of Teesta River, which washed away several bridges, damaged parts of NH-10, Chungthang Dam and had impacted several small towns and several infrastructure projects in the upper reaches of the Teesta River valley. The districts of Namchi, Gangtok, Mangan and Pakyong are severely affected. While scientists are still investigating the exact cause of the flash flood, the primary reason for the sudden surge has been found to be a GLOF (Glacial Lake Outburst Flood) event at South Lhonak lake in North Sikkim. The lake is at a height of 5,200 meters, with a towering ice-capped feature at about 6,800 meters to the north of and in close proximity to the lake. Satellite images received from NRSC, ISRO, reveal the draining out of more than half the lake. CWC’s monitoring stations revealed that the first surge of water was 19 meters above the maximum water level at Sangkalang at 0130 hrs, falling to 4 meters above the maximum water level at Melli at 0400 hrs.",

Key messages for this weekly report are presented below: Rainfall and its forecast Rainfall focused in the areas from Chiang Saen in Thailand to Tan Chau and Chau Doc in Viet Nam, including the upper, middle and lower parts of the LMB covering Lao PDR and Cambodia, varying from 21.90 millimetres (mm) to 277.30 mm. There will be below moderate and moderate rainfall for the next 5 days over the Mekong region from 10 to 14 October 2023 although there is no any movement of tropical storm moving towards the Mekong region. Water level and its forecast - According to MRC’s observed water level at Jinghong, it showed fluctuating water levels between 536.12 m and 537.13 m during 03-09 October 2023. The current level is staying about 0.86 m higher than its LTA value. The outflow at Jinghong station varied between 1,460.00 m3 /s and 2,270.00 m3 /s between 03 and 09 October 2023. With the fluctuated outflow from Jinghong upstream and rainfall at catchment inflow, water levels of monitoring stations at Chiang Saen in Thailand increased about 0.26 m from 03 to 09 October 2023, staying about 0.41 m lower than its LTA level. Water level at Xieng Kok upstream of Chiang Saen increased about 1.61 m. Water level at Chiang Khan in Thailand from 03 to 09 October 2023 decreased about 0.07 m and stayed about 1.14 m higher than its LTA value, while water level at Vientiane decreased about 0.53 m staying about 1.72 higher than its LTA level. Water levels at Nong Khai decreased 0.95 m and stayed about 0.75 m lower than its LTA, while at Paksane it decreased about 0.40 m, staying about 0.57 m higher than its LTA value. Water levels at these stations are considered normal. Water levels from Nakhon Phanom to Pakse increased from 0.08 m to 0.65 m, due to the contribution of moderate to heavy rainfalls and inflows from upstream. The current WLs at these stations are staying higher than their LTA value, considering normal. From the stretches of the river at Stung Treng, water levels decreased about 0.44 m and stayed 0.83 m higher than its LTA values, while at Kratie the water levels decreased about 1.34 m and stayed 1.02 m higher than their LTA values, which were considered normal. Water level at Kompong Cham is about 0.14 m lower than its LTA value. The water volume of the Tonle Sap Lake was lower than its LTA (about 72%) during the same period from 03 to 09 October 2023, which is considered low. Water levels from downstream at Chaktomuk and Phnom Penh Port, Koh Khel on the Bassac river in Cambodia decreased between 0.05 m and 0.10 m, staying lower than their LTA level excepted at Kho Khel the water level is stayed higher than its LTA level. Water levels at Prek Kdam on the Tonle Sap River increased about 0.10 m, staying 1.01 m lower than its LTA value. The current water levels for most of the stations are lower than their LTA value. WLs at the 2 tidal stations at Tan Chau and Chau Doc were fluctuating and lower than their LTA value, due to tidal effect during this monitoring period, considered critical. Over the next five days, the water levels at the middle and lower parts from Nakhon Phanom to Stung Treng and Kratie will go down due to low-average rainfall and dam/reservoir operations upstream, while at downstream from Phnom Penh down to the Mekong floodplain area they are also going to fall. Drought condition and its forecast During Sep 25-Oct 1, the LMB was not facing any serious threat. Only Phongsaly of Lao PDR was having some moderate drought. Other areas were normal or wet. The monthly drought forecast shows that October is likely wet in the north, eastern part and 3S area. While in November, moderate drought conditions are forecasted for certain areas of Vientiane, Chaiyaphum, as well as Sakon Nakhon provinces in the north, while the eastern and 3S areas of the region are expected to be relatively wet.",

          "fullText": "Seventy-eighth session Item 73 (c) of the provisional agenda* Promotion and protection of human rights: human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives. Situation of human rights in Afghanistan. Note by the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General has the honour to transmit to the General Assembly the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution    Summary. The present report, submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, builds on his previous report and covers developments, mainly from February to August 2023. I. Introduction. 1. The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 51/20 . , provides an outline of human rights developments in Afghanistan, mainly between February and August 2023. It builds on the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session (A/77/552), as well as his reports to the Human Rights Council. 2. To date, the Special Rapporteur has undertaken three missions to Afghanistan since assuming the mandate in May 2022, including a joint mission with the Chair of the Working Group on discrimination against women and girls in April and May 2023. 3. During these missions, the Special Rapporteur visited Kabul, Mazar-e Sharif, Kandahar, Bamyan and Panjshir Provinces. He met with numerous stakeholders and was received by senior de facto officials, including the acting Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers and senior officials at the provincial level. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the de facto authorities’ cooperation with the mandate, including their written submissions to his communications and reports. 4. The Special Rapporteur also engaged in regular interactions with a broad range of stakeholders outside the country, by participating in in-person and online events. II. Background. 5. Since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate. While a broad spectrum of rights has been restricted or abused by the de facto authorities, the most prominent case is the extreme curtailment of the rights of women and girls. The de facto authorities have introduced numerous edicts and instructions that have deprived women and girls of their basic rights, including the rights to education, work, freedom of movement and participation in political and public life. These restrictions include bans on Afghan women from working for non-governmental organization (NGOs) in December 2022 and for the United Nations in April 2023, which have had a negative impact on humanitarian operations across the country. Other fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedom of expression, opinion and assembly, the rights to life, physical integrity and access to justice, and the rights of minorities, have been systematically violated, affecting the entire community. Civic space continues to shrink and civil society activists, journalists and peaceful protesters continue to be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention, and ill-treatment. On 13 November 2022, the de facto authorities announced the reintroduction of qisas (retribution in kind) and hudud (crimes against God) punishments, meaning that the application of the death penalty in public has resumed, alongside other inhuman and degrading punishments. 1 According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), a significant number of individuals were subjected to public flogging, including 74 men, 58 women and 2 boys, between November 2022 and April 2023.2. 6. The Taliban claims not only that their policies are necessary to comply with the sharia, but that they are also popular with Afghans living in the country. This is strongly contested by other Afghans who resist Taliban rule. The continued suppression of women’s rights has undoubtedly had a negative impact on the popularity of the Taliban locally. It has also created major obstacles for any steps towards recognition by the international community. 7. The de facto authorities have failed to establish an administration that is inclusive of women and all ethnic and religious groups. Furthermore, the de facto administration continues to be composed entirely of men, predominantly of Pashtun ethnicity. The Taliban leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, is apparently tightening his direct grip over State affairs, notably the security and intelligence sectors, and the reshuffling of judicial, security and civil officials, in particular at the subnational level, has become more frequent. He has also moved the spokesperson’s office of the de facto authorities from Kabul to Kandahar and established religious councils with decision-making power in over 20 provinces. 8. An estimated 85 per cent of Afghans live below the poverty line and the provision of humanitarian assistance is under stress. More than halfway through the year, the 2023 Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan remains severely underfunded with only $744 million received as at 31 July, which is less than half of the amount ($1.49 billion) received as at the same time in 2022. Bans on Afghan female aid workers have also generated additional financial and operating costs that require greater donor flexibility and funding. The World Food Programme has warned that funding will run out by October 2023 as a result of reduced donor funding, which could further affect millions of Afghans. 9. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly heard from Afghan women and men that the distribution of assistance is frequently uneven and can be difficult to obtain, in particular for minority groups, older persons, female-headed households and persons with disabilities, and that distribution reportedly favours Taliban supporters. The ban on female staff affects the effectiveness of humanitarian actors in delivering services to women and girls, resulting in a narrow focus and reduced understanding of the needs of affected populations.",

Situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán. Nota del Secretario General. El Secretario General tiene el honor de transmitir a la Asamblea General el informe del Relator Especial sobre la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán, Richard Bennett, de conformidad con la resolución    del Consejo de Derechos Humanos. Resumen. El presente informe, elaborado por el Relator Especial sobre la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán, Richard Bennett, se basa en su informe anterior y abarca la evolución de la situación principalmente entre febrero y agosto de 2023. I. Introducción. 1. En el presente informe, elaborado en cumplimiento de la resolución 51/20 del Consejo de Derechos Humanos, se resume la evolución de la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán, principalmente entre febrero y agosto de 2023. El informe se basa en el que el Relator Especial presentó a la Asamblea General en su septuagésimo séptimo período de sesiones ( A/77/552 ), así como en sus informes al Consejo de Derechos Humanos. 2. Desde que asumió el mandato en mayo de 2022 y hasta la fecha, el Relator Especial ha llevado a cabo tres misiones en el Afganistán, incluida una misión conjunta con la Presidenta del Grupo de Trabajo sobre la cuestión de la discriminación contra las mujeres y las niñas en abril y mayo de 2023. 3. Durante esas misiones, el Relator Especial visitó las provincias de Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar, Bamiyán y Panjsher. Se reunió con numerosas partes interesadas y fue recibido por altos funcionarios de la administración de facto, entre ellos los Vice Primeros Ministros interinos, Ministros y altos funcionarios provinciales. El Relator Especial agradece a las autoridades de facto su cooperación con el mandato, en particular sus contribuciones escritas a sus comunicaciones e informes. 4. El Relator Especial también mantuvo contactos periódicos con un amplio abanico de partes interesadas fuera del país, mediante su participación en eventos presenciales y en línea. II. Antecedentes. 5. Desde que los talibanes tomaron el poder en agosto de 2021, la situación de los derechos humanos en el Afganistán ha seguido deteriorándose. Si bien las autoridades de facto han restringido o vulnerado un amplio espectro de derechos, el ejemplo más destacado es la restricción extrema de los derechos de las mujeres y las niñas. Las autoridades de facto han emitido numerosos edictos y órdenes que han privado a las mujeres y las niñas de sus derechos básicos, entre ellos los derechos a la educación, al trabajo, a la libertad de circulación y a la participación en la vida política y pública. Esas restricciones comprenden la prohibición de que las mujeres afganas trabajen para organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG), impuesta en diciembre de 2022, y para las Naciones Unidas, impuesta en abril de 2023, lo que ha repercutido negativamente en las operaciones humanitarias en todo el país. Además se han violado sistemáticamente otros derechos y libertades fundamentales, como las libertades de expresión, de opinión y de reunión, los derechos a la vida, a la integridad física y al acceso a la justicia, y los derechos de las minorías, lo que ha afectado a toda la comunidad. El espacio cívico sigue reduciéndose, y los activistas de la sociedad civil, los periodistas y los manifestantes pacíficos siguen siendo objeto de detención y reclusión arbitrarias, y de malos tratos. El 13 de noviembre de 2022, las autoridades de facto anunciaron la reinstauración de los castigos en aplicación de la quisas (ley del talión) y por delitos hudud (crímenes contra Dios), lo que significa que se ha vuelto a aplicar la pena de muerte en público, junto con otros castigos inhumanos y degradantes. Según la Misión de Asistencia de las Naciones Unidas en el Afganistán (UNAMA), entre noviembre de 2022 y abril de 2023 se sometió a flagelación pública a un número considerable de personas, a saber, 74 hombres, 58 mujeres y 2 niños. 6. Los talibanes afirman no solo que sus políticas son necesarias para cumplir la sharia islámica, sino también que son populares entre los afganos que viven en el país, una afirmación que rechazan enérgicamente otros afganos que se oponen al régimen talibán. No cabe duda de que la supresión sistemática de los derechos de las mujeres ha afectado a la popularidad de los talibanes a nivel local. También ha dificultado enormemente cualquier paso hacia el reconocimiento por la comunidad internacional. 7. Las autoridades de facto no han establecido una administración que incluya a las mujeres y a todos los grupos étnicos y religiosos. Es más, la administración de facto sigue estando integrada exclusivamente por hombres, predominantemente de etnia pastún. Los informes indican que el líder talibán, Haibatullah Akhundzada, está estrechando su control directo sobre los asuntos de Estado, en particular en los sectores de seguridad e inteligencia, y cada vez son más frecuentes las reorganizaciones de funcionarios judiciales, civiles y de seguridad, sobre todo a nivel subnacional. También ha trasladado la oficina del portavoz de las autoridades de facto de Kabul a Kandahar y ha establecido consejos religiosos con facultades decisorias en más de 20 provincias. 8. Se calcula que el 85 % de los afganos vive por debajo del umbral de pobreza, y la prestación de ayuda humanitaria pasa por grandes dificultades. Transcurrida más de la mitad del año, el Plan de Respuesta Humanitaria para el Afganistán de 2023 sigue teniendo un déficit grave de financiación, ya que al 31 de julio solamente había recibido 744 millones de dólares, monto que representa menos de la mitad del recibido en la misma fecha de 2022 (1.490 millones de dólares). Las prohibiciones impuestas a las trabajadoras humanitarias afganas también han ocasionado gastos financieros y de funcionamiento adicionales que requieren de los donantes mayor flexibilidad y financiación. El Programa Mundial de Alimentos ha advertido de que sus fondos se agotarán en octubre de 2023 debido a los recortes en los fondos aportados por los donantes, lo que podría agravar la situación de millones de afganos. 9. El Relator Especial ha escuchado decir en repetidas ocasiones a mujeres y hombres afganos que la distribución de la ayuda suele ser desigual y puede ser difícil de obtener, en particular para los grupos minoritarios, las personas mayores, los hogares encabezados por mujeres y las personas con discapacidad, y que la distribución parece favorecer a los partidarios de los talibanes. La prohibición de emplear a personal femenino limita la eficiencia de los agentes humanitarios en l a prestación de servicios a las mujeres y las niñas, lo que da lugar a un enfoque limitado y a que se conozcan peor las necesidades de las poblaciones afectadas.",

Brief Plan International Pacific Background: Plan International Pacific (PIP) operates in a region with significant developmental challenges, posing enormous opportunities and difficulties for girls and young women. Gender related issues related to violence, leadership, educational, health and economic security exhibit alarmingly high disparities compared to other countries in the APAC region. countries. These challenges, compounded by the impact of climate change and the the consequences of increased disasters in the Pacific, affect all our operational areas and will continue to challenge all Pacific nations in the years ahead. PIP is addressing the rights of girls and women through a myriad of programs which are aligned to the Global Strategy of Plan International. Plan International has had a presence in the Pacific region since 2012. PIP operates as a Country Office (CO), with the Fiji Hub functioning as the CO and offices in Bougainville (PNG) and the Solomon Islands as program units (PUs). PIP reports directly to the Asia-Pacific (APAC) regional office in Bangkok. There has been a historical transition of programs internally in Plan Intonational from Plan International Australia (PIA) to APAC in 2020. This transition has shown great success in enriching the lives of girls and young women across the Pacific region, in both the development and humanitarian space. It has also been a time presented with challenges due to issues such as CoVID-19 and various other operational matters. 2. Where We Are Now - Current State: PIP continues to address the needs of vulnerable populations and remains committed to long term support to communities in the Pacific. There is a current ‘draft’ Country Program Strategy for Fiji, PNG and Solomon Islands aimed at girls rights and sectors that support their ability to learn, lead, decide and thrive in their environment. To delivery effectively on this ambitious program strategy, the APAC Regional Leadership, in partnership with Plan Pacific and PIA, aims to review the current operating model to address issues faced by girls in the Pacific by improving operational efficiency, effective governance and sustainable impact.

          "fullText": "The objective of this study was to assess the combined impact of environmental microplastic pollution and biological invasion which represent critical global eco-environmental challenges. The invasion of Solidago canadensis L. and soil microplastic contamination in the agroecosystem pose severe hazards to soil and plant ecology and human health. Oryza sativa L. (rice) was examined after individual and combined exposure to Solidago canadensis L. invasion (SI) and soil polyethylene microplastic contamination (MPc). Comparing the individual and combination treatments to the control, leaf biomass decreased, with varying changes in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Antioxidant enzyme activity and reactive oxygen species levels were significantly reduced following SI exposure and increased following the combined treatment (SI × MP). In contrast, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase activities were reduced after the combined treatment. Due to the confluence of various abiotic stressors, the combined treatment had a higher impact on leaf metabolites than the singular SI and MPc treatments. However, in comparison, the combined treatment significantly influenced the metabolic profile. In conclusion, the interaction between SI and MPc resulted in significant metabolic alterations. These changes were characterized by shifts in metabolite pools influenced by antioxidant enzyme activities and nutrient content, ultimately enhancing defense mechanisms within rice crops. Consequently, these stressors threaten the food safety, sustainability, and agricultural output of crops. The co -exposure of invasive plants and microplastics sheds light on the bio-ecological risks associated with microplastics in staple foods and offers valuable insights into the phytotoxicity of invasive plants in the presence of polyethylene microplastics.",

Ammonia, a nitrogen-containing product, as well as a nutrient, is promoted as a low-carbon fuel for the maritime sector, with spectacular production increase in plan. Similar to any other widespread fuels in the past, it is paramount to be prepared for the potential environmental impact of ammonia fuel. Here, through our preliminary calculations using literature data, we suggest that the amount of ammonia to be produced to fulfil the maritime energy need by 2050 may entail large alterations in global nitrogen cycling. Currently, the literature based on limited known cases of ammonia excess is insufficient to quantify the environmental impacts caused by the probable increase in bunkering ammonia release at global scale. With a few knowledge gaps identified, we call on the marine science community to investigate the potential environmental impact related to substantial ammonia excess, contributing new knowledge to a more environmentally sustainable future.",

So far, we have enough water in the system to take care of our needs, but that does not mean that we must go about wasting the water. We must conserve the fresh water that we have in the conservancies,” the agriculture minister stated. He noted that currently the water level at the conservancies is at normal height and he hopes that it remains.    Guyana is currently experiencing the El Nino weather phenomenon, however, Minister Mustapha disclosed that there are no serious threats caused by the dry weather conditions. “I don’t think we are experiencing any serious problems with the dry spell so far.

          "fullText": "Today, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a new financing partnership to address critical global health opportunities: eradicating polio and ensuring that innovations in health are more accessible to the people who need them most. The World Health Organization and UNICEF, as implementing partners for the polio funding, will deploy the resources to eradicate polio, support the distribution of other childhood immunizations and strengthen health systems so they are better able to respond to emerging health threats. The expected €1.1 billion financing package aims to provide new funding to eradicate a human disease for only the second time in history and help solve the health and development challenges faced by the world’s most vulnerable people, who otherwise do not get fair access to healthcare services and innovations. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: “We are about to wipe polio off the face of the Earth. The European Commission, the EIB and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are partnering to get through the final stretch. With 1 billion euros supported by our European investment strategy Global Gateway, we will invest in stronger health systems globally and local vaccine and medicines production, manufacturing and administration, where it is most needed. Global cooperation has helped us put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now it will help us get rid of polio once and for all.” The partnership marks a significant increase in funding for global health and human development under the European Commission’s European Fund for Sustainable Development plus (EFSD+) and is expected to include a match of new complementary funding for global health by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, maximising the impact of every Euro committed by the EU and the European Investment Bank. “Today we are united to write the final chapter in the history of polio. The European Investment Bank is playing its part in a unique partnership with philanthropy and health partners, by providing EUR 500 million for investment in support of the Global Polio Eradication Programme. This initiative will be a milestone in scaling up immunization and strengthening healthcare, ensuring that every child, regardless of their circumstances, can be protected against polio,” said Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank. To promote swift progress towards eradicating wild poliovirus, the partnership aims to deliver €500 million in payments to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative specifically the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The funds will cover polio vaccinations for nearly 370 million children annually; deliver vital health services to children alongside polio campaigns, including measles vaccines and other routine immunizations; and strengthen health systems to better prepare and respond to emerging health threats, as the polio program has done against COVID-19, Ebola, and other diseases. Today, wild poliovirus remains endemic in just two countries Pakistan and Afghanistan and 80% of variant poliovirus cases are found in just four subnational regions. “Thanks to medical innovations, the world eradicated one human disease smallpox. Today we’re on the verge of ending another wild poliovirus. I am committed to ensuring that no child, anywhere in the world, faces this awful disease. I am also optimistic that we will eradicate polio once and for all and make health innovations more accessible for everyone, particularly those in the poorest countries,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Another €500 million aims to expand the innovation capacity of health systems in low- and middle-income countries. This includes new funding to initiatives supported by the European Commission such as efforts to make health innovations like mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics more accessible to people in low- and middle-income countries, under Europe’s investment plan for the world, Global Gateway. More investments in health worldwide will be discussed among global leaders and partners at the upcoming    (25-26 October) “Thanks to the leadership and partnership of the European Commission and European Investment Bank, vaccines, medicines and other life-saving innovations should reach the people who need them most, making communities everywhere healthier. We know that when a community is healthy, economies grow,” said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “Reaching un- or under-vaccinated children in the most remote and hardest-to-reach areas is essential for finishing the job of polio eradication,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “These new funds will not only help to drive us towards a polio-free world, but will also help to build more sustainable and resilient health systems to protect the same children and communities who are at risk of polio against the many other health threats they face.” “Polio eradication is within reach, but the progress is fragile, and we must remain laser focused,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “This new funding will help ensure that all children get vaccinated to eradicate polio, while strengthening community-based health systems. No child should suffer from an easily preventable disease.” Specifically, the funding partnership is expected to include: €500 million in new funding for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (as outlined above) €500 million in investments and grants to ensure health innovations are more accessible, strengthen health systems and prepare for future pandemics : The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation plans to provide €250 million of grants and investments to match a €250 million in investments made by the European Investment Bank and guaranteed by the European Fund for Sustainable Development plus. €80 million grants for Technical Assistance: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation expects to match €40 million in grants from the European Commission to provide technical assistance and ensure that global health programs achieve their full potential. The partnership announced today builds from existing partnerships between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Commission and Member States, including a €100 million support package for the recently established African Medicines Agency (AMA) and national African medicines regulatory agencies or regional initiatives, the African Health Diagnostics Platform, which supports African partners to increase access and reduce costs of laboratory testing, and coordination on health initiatives such as COVAX , a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

Encabezado por la Dirección de Control de Enfermedades Transmitidas por Vectores, y en coordinación con gobiernos provinciales, se desplegó un dispositivo de vigilancia y monitoreo orientado a recolectar datos temporo-espaciales sobre los insectos vectores y detectar de manera oportuna información sobre los parámetros entomológicos, para realizar los ajustes necesarios a las estrategias nacionales y jurisdiccionales de prevención y control de esta problemática de salud. En ese sentido, equipos conformados por agentes técnico-territoriales de la cartera sanitaria nacional, se abocaron a la búsqueda activa del vector del paludismo (mosquitos anofelinos) en las localidades de Yuto (Jujuy), Salvador Mazza, Aguas Blancas (Salta) y Puerto Iguazú (Misiones). En simultáneo con las acciones de monitoreo y vigilancia, se realizaron actividades de capacitación y sensibilización a referentes provinciales y equipos de vigilancia epidemiológica, y se acompañaron procesos de búsqueda activa de casos para realizar estudios diagnósticos. En 2019, la OMS certificó a la Argentina como país libre de paludismo, para casos autóctonos. En este marco, el Ministerio de Salud sostiene y renueva anualmente la implementación del Plan de Prevención de reintroducción del paludismo en Argentina, mediante el cual se establecen los lineamientos para la vigilancia epidemiológica y entomológica, el diagnóstico laboratorial, las acciones para el fortalecimiento en los equipos de salud para el manejo clínico de casos y la articulación con la OPS/OMS para la adquisición de medicamentos y asesoría externa. Que es el paludismo y cómo se transmite. El paludismo o malaria es una enfermedad potencialmente mortal causada por la infección de una o más de cinco especies de parásitos protozoarios intracelulares: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae y Plasmodium knowlesi que se transmiten al ser humano por la picadura de mosquitos hembra infectados del género Anopheles. La transmisión de la enfermedad se produce cuando la hembra del mosquito Anopheles pica a una persona que padece una infección palúdica. Es decir, que contiene en su sangre el parásito plasmodium, y luego el mismo mosquito pica a otra persona sana infectándola.

          "fullText": "El responsable de la cartera Sanitaria, recorrió la actividad acompañado de agentes socio sanitarios y personal de la dirección de Salud Ambiental. Al respecto, el ministro de Salud Pública, doctor Luis Medina Ruiz , comentó: “Estamos trabajando en la semana de prevención del dengue, como todo el año, previniendo, ya que esta es una amenaza que afortunadamente no hay en Tucumán desde el 1 de agosto, pero si hay en todo el norte de la Argentina, en el Chaco, Bolivia, Brasil y Paraguay”. Y añadió: “Hoy en Lules estamos realizando una buena labor como siempre, junto al gobierno local, con el señor Intendente Carlos Gallia y su equipo en una tarea articulada eliminando los cacharros y concientizando a la población de combatir cualquier criadero de mosquitos, ya sea una tapita, tacho, maceta, cualquier lugar donde pueda haber agua estancada. Hemos encontrado en una manzana de 30 a 40 casas, tres casas que tenían larvas, y lamentablemente, que en una sola casa haya larvas, es suficiente para generar focos de contagio para todas las personas que viven en esa manzana”. “Tenemos que tomar conciencia que el trabajo no termina, todos los días tenemos que controlar nuestra casa, el patio, la plaza cercana y hablar con los vecinos, ponernos de acuerdo entre los vecinos para dar vuelta todos los tachitos, si hay alguno tiene ese borde que parece de suciedad, saber que ahí están los huevitos depositados y allí se desarrollará el mosquito”, agregó. Por su parte; la titular de la Dirección General de Salud Ambiental, ingeniera Julieta Migliavacca , dijo: “Estamos en Lules, realizando un operativo que ha cubierto 12 manzanas, acompañado por el área de Saneamiento Ambiental del municipio que nos ha provisto de máquinas y camiones para la eliminación de los inservibles, y con todo el equipo de la dirección de Salud Ambiental y agentes socio sanitarios del área operativa que nos acompañan en este operativo”. “Hemos encontrado muchas viviendas con recipientes que almacenan agua para riego, así hicimos un trabajo muy importante de concientización a la comunidad sobre la importancia de recambiar esta agua para eliminar los recipientes que son potenciales criadero de mosquitos, mostrándole cuáles son las larvas y las pupas. Hemos encontrado algunos aedes aegypti adultos que, si bien estamos sin circulación de la enfermedad del dengue en este momento en la provincia, son muy importante estas actividades de prevención para bajar la población de aedes, para que en caso de que llegue el dengue tengamos menos posibilidades de transmisión, y sobre todo para que cada uno controle en sus viviendas de los potenciales criaderos”, destacó. Asimismo, la profesional contó que del operativo participaron más de 50 personas, incluyendo agentes del área operativa de Lules y los agentes socio sanitarios. “Trabajamos con ellos que conocen el terreno, a los vecinos que nos abren las puertas de las viviendas, está también el área de prevención de vectores de la dirección de Salud Ambiental con los operarios que tienen el ojo crítico y saben dónde buscar cuando entran a las viviendas”, afirmó. “Es momento de cuidarnos, prevenir, usar repelentes y al primer síntoma consultar al centro asistencial más cercano, para que en caso de sospecha de dengue se pueda detectar ese primer caso y nosotros podamos hacer las acciones de bloqueo”, enfatizó. Finalmente, el secretario de Saneamiento e Inspección de la municipalidad de Lules, licenciado en biotecnología Roberto Ortiz expresó: “Estamos trabajando en forma permanente, siempre con el acompañamiento de nuestro ministro Luis Medina Ruiz , que ha estado en forma permanente en contacto con nosotros, con nuestro intendente en el trabajo contra el dengue. Estamos haciendo concientización casa por casa, en las redes sociales, sobre cómo es el trabajo que hay que hacer para evitar los criaderos de mosquitos. Desde el gobierno local se pide nuevamente el compromiso de toda la población a cuidar la casa de cada uno”, cerró. Galería de fotos",

Los factores de virulencia que más se han relacionado con patogenicidad son la motilidad por la presencia de flagelos, la capacidad de adherencia e invasión a la célula eucarionte y la producción de citotoxinas. La reposición de líquidos y electrolitos es el tratamiento recomendado, y los antimicrobianos se requieren solo en la enfermedad grave y/o prolongada. Objetivo : Caracterizar los factores de virulencia y la resistencia antimicrobiana en cepas de Campylobacter spp., aislados de pacientes con síndrome diarreico agudo en el Laboratorio Central de Salud Pública, periodo 2020 - 2021. Metodología : El tipo de estudio utilizado fue retrospectivo de corte transversal, tomando como periodo de estudio los años 2020 y 2021, como criterio de inclusión se consideraron todas las cepas aisladas de muestras que se remitieron con la ficha epidemiológica para el estudio de Enfermedades Diarreicas Agudas (EDAS) en el periodo de estudio de 2020-2021. Resultados : Fueron sometidas a estudio unas 168 cepas de Campylobacter spp., donde se observó un predominio de la especie Campylobacter jejuni con un porcentaje de 95% (160/168 ) seguido de Campylobacter coli con un 5 % ( 8/168 ). Se detectaron todos los factores de virulencia investigados siendo el de mayor frecuencia flaA (96%) y ctdC (94%), seguido de cadF (86.9%), ctdB (85%), dnaJ (79.7%), racC (71%) y en menor porcentaje se detectó pldA (49%), ciaB (21%), wlaN (13%) y virB (2%). En cuanto a la resistencia antimicrobiana de las cepas de Campylobacter spp., en este estudio se pudo observar un 51 % de resistencia a ciprofloxacina, 6 % de resistencia a tetraciclina; mientras que para eritromicina se observó una sensibilidad del 100%. Conclusión : La identificación de los factores de virulencia implicados en los procesos infecciosos, así como el conocimiento de la resistencia antimicrobiana del agente etiológico constituyen la clave para mejorar la comprensión de la patogénesis y el desarrollo de terapias para el tratamiento de las infecciones presentadas por este patógeno.",
